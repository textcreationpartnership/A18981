            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:653:7"/> meere vſurpation they take vnto them the name of <hi>Catholikes.</hi> After this I entred by occaſion to a compariſon betwixt the new that is, and that that of old was the religion of the Church of Rome, conſiſting ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of three parts. In the firſt I ſhewed that neither the Epiſtle of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, which is the briefe of the religion which they at the firſt receiued, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as I ſhewed out of <hi>Theodoret, all manner doctrine of faith,</hi> nor yet the two Epiſtles of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> whom they make the founder of their Church, doe containe any defence of the doctrine now taught at Rome, but doe teach only our religion. In the ſecond I ſet downe ſundry definitions and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the ancient Roman faith, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Biſhops of Rome and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, that haue witneſſed the doctrine of that Church, wholly conſonant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that that we teach, and altogether impugned by the Roman Church that now is. In the third I declared that there were ſundry hereſies, condemned of old by the Roman Church, which the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:653:7"/> Rome now embraceth and defendeth. The points of this compariſon I then ſet downe only poſitiuely, the occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no more, not reſpecting what cauilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the aduerſary might bring for oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof; the matter being by that light that I gaue very cleare, that the Church of Rome is not now the ſame that it was of old. This matter I afterwards thought worthy of a larger treatiſe, and purpoſed when opportunity ſhould ſerue a more full proſecution of it, thinking it would bee a great comfort and eſtabliſhment to the conſciences of many men, perhaps to ſome an occaſion of better minde, when they ſhould ſee in that Church of Rome, that now is ſuch a plain repugnancy to that that of old was, which notwithſtanding taketh vpon it impudently to haue beene alwaies the ſame, and to bee the only certaine rule and oracle of true faith.

To this therefore I haue addreſſed my deſcription of <hi>the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:653:8"/> Catholike,</hi> forbearing that more orderly courſe which I had intended, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this worke, and chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow him ſteppe by ſteppe, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I haue done; only beginning where hee commeth to the purpoſe, and leauing all his vagaries and affected diſcourſes to be more briefly touched in the end of all. Of this worke I haue yet finiſhed but only one part, wherin I haue at large diſcouered their vaine oſtentation of the Catholike name and faith, and ſhewed plainely that the Romiſh religion now accordeth not with <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the Romans, no, nor with his other Epiſtles, which <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> calleth to aſsiſt him, becauſe he findeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to helpe him in that Epiſtle to the Romans. In all which I haue beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, gentle Reader, to giue thee ſatisfaction by the cleare teſtimony either of ſome lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Biſhops of Rome, or of ſome other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly approued and commended in that Church. Being now required a ſeruice of another kinde, ſo that I cannot yet goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the reſt, I haue thought good to
<pb facs="tcp:653:9"/> publiſh this in the meane time. If I haue promiſed any thing in this that is not here performed, expect it in that that is to come.

                     <hi>BVt let vs giue him leaue to wander whither his fancy leadeth him, that we may at length heare what he would ſay: It is forſooth,</hi> That the Church of Rome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:653:14"/> doth abſurdly call her ſelfe the Catholike Church, and that Papiſts doe abſurdly take to themſelues the name of Catholikes, becauſe the Catholike Church is the vniuerſall Church, but the Church of Rome is a particular Church; therefore to ſay the Roman Catholike Church, is all one as to ſay the vniuerſall particular Church. <hi>Here is a well ſhapen argument, and worthy the maker; it conſiſts of all particular propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which euery ſmatterer in Logicke knowes to be moſt vitious: beſides, not one of them is good, but all are ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and full of deceit. Firſt, concerning the forme, if it were currant one might prouely it, that no one Church in the world were Catholike; take (for example) the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh congregation (which they hold to be moſt Catholike) and apply</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Abbots <hi>argument to it thus:</hi> The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church is the vniuerſall Church, but the Church of England is a particular Church; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay the Engliſh Church is Catholike, is to ſay a particular Church is an vniuerſall. <hi>His firſt fault then is in the very forme of reaſoning, which alone is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to argue him to be a Sophiſter, and one that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to beguile them that will truſt him: now to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. His firſt propoſition</hi> (the Catholike Church is the vniuerſall Church) <hi>is both abſurd, becauſe the ſame thing is affirmed of himſelfe (for vniuerſall is no diſtinct thing, but the very interpretation of the word Catholike) and alſo captious, as hauing a double ſignification. For the Catholike Church doth ſignifie both the whole body of the Church, compacted of all the particular members vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ioyned together in one; in which ſenſe no one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church can be called the Catholike Church, becauſe it is not the whole body ſpred ouer all the world; for it is</hi>

Auguſtine, <hi>that Chriſtians were called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,</hi> Ex communicatione totius orbis, By hauing<note place="margin">Epiſtola. 48.</note> communion of faith with the whole world. <hi>If then by his owne confeſsion euery particular Church, yea euery particular Chriſtian, that imbraceth and profeſſeth that faith which is dilated all the world ouer, be truly called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike; how fondly then did he goe about to proue the Church of Rome not to be Catholike, and Papiſts not to be Catholikes, becauſe forſooth they were particulars? Yet that he may be thought not to dote outright, but rather to dreame, he addeth:</hi> That at leaſt the Church of Rome hath no reaſon to aſſume to her ſelfe the prerogatiue of that title, becauſe that euery Church where the true faith is taught, is truly called Catholike, and no one more then another. <hi>I note firſt, that this man is as conſtant and ſtable, as the weather-cocke on the toppe of a ſteeple: before he proued ſtoutly (as you haue heard) that no particular Church could be called Catholike; now he will haue euery particular Church that receiueth the true
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:653:15"/> faith, to be called Catholike. Neither doe we ſay that any one Oxthodoxe Church, is more Catholike then another, if the word Catholike be taken preciſely; though we hold, that among all the particular Catholikes, the Roman hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the greateſt priuiledges, both of ſuperiority in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and of continuance and ſtability in the ſame true Catholike faith, which is deduced out of the word of God; becauſe that Church</hi> is the Rocke (<hi>according to the</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:653:17"/> muſt needes be meant of their Roman Church. But for the pulling of this viſard from their faces, I noted the abſurdity that is implied in that ſtile of <hi>the Catholike Roman Church: for the Catholike Church,</hi> ſay I, <hi>is the vniuerſall Church; The Roman Church is a particular Church; therefore to ſay, the Catholike Roman Church, is all one as to ſay, the vniuerſall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church.</hi> Againſt this <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> as a notable Logician taketh exception as <hi>an ill ſhapen argument, conſiſting all of particular propoſitions,</hi> as if I had here intended a Categorical ſyllogiſme, in moode and figure, which no ſmatterer but himſelfe would euer haue dreamed. The wordes haue plaine implication of an Hypothetical ſyllogiſme ſeruing to inferre an abſurdity againſt them: If <hi>the Catholike Church</hi> be the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Church, &amp; the Roman Church a particular Church, then to ſay, <hi>the Catholike Roman Church,</hi> is as to ſay, <hi>the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall particular Church.</hi> But it is abſurd to ſay, <hi>the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall particular Church.</hi> Therefore it is abſurd to ſay, <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Roman Church.</hi> Will he haue it reduced for him to a Categoricall ſyllogiſme in moode and figure? Let him take it thus; No particular Church can be the Catholike Church. But the Church of Rome is a particular Church. Therefore the Church of Rome cannot be the Catholike Church. Muſt I proue the <hi>maior?</hi> No particular Church can be the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church. But the Catholike Church is the vniuerſall Church. Therefore no particular Church can be the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. So learned a Doctor ſhould not thus haue played boyes-play, but ſhould of himſelfe haue conceiued theſe things being cleare and plaine, without any new aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement thereof by the ſimple Miniſter. But <hi>by this forme,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a man might proue that no one Church in the world were Catholike.</hi> But keepe your termes aright <hi>M. Biſhop,</hi> and ſay as you ſhould, <hi>that no one Church in the world is the Catholike Church,</hi> and then it is true that by the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is proued that no one Church in the world (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches being each and euery of them but a part) can be called <hi>the Catholike or Vniuerſall Church,</hi> which is the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:653:17"/> whole. And tell vs I pray, good Sir, haue yee found that any of ours hath entitled the Church of England to the name of <hi>the Catholike Church?</hi> If not, why then doe you thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe your Reader, to put that for an inſtance, as if we affirmed it ſo to be? The truth is, gentle Reader that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to blinde thee by altering the termes that by mee were ſet downe, naming <hi>a Catholike Church,</hi> which importeth ſoundneſſe of doctrine in any one Church; whereas I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>the Catholike Church,</hi> as importing the vniuerſall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the whole Church. It followeth not indeede that becauſe a Church is particular, therefore it is not <hi>Catholike,</hi> that is, ſound in doctrine; but it followeth that becauſe a Church is particular, therefore it is not <hi>the Catholike,</hi> that is, the vniuerſall Church. Let him direct the argument againſt the Church of England, as I did againſt the Church of Rome, and it ſhall be as ſtrong againſt the Church of England as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of Rome. Let him ſay, and wee will not contradict him, <hi>The Catholike Church is the vniuerſall Church; the Church of England is a particular Church; therefore to ſay the Catholike Engliſh Church, is as abſurd as to ſay the vniuerſall particular Church;</hi> or more nearely to his owne wordes, <hi>Therefore to ſay, the Church of England is the Catholike Church, is the ſame as to ſay, a particular Church is the vniuerſall Church.</hi> But he turneth the concluſion, <hi>that the Church of England is not Catholike, which we hold to be most Catholike,</hi> declaring by that addition that he referreth <hi>Catholike</hi> by a Donatiſticall fallacy to quality of doctrine and faith, becauſe <hi>more Catholike</hi> and <hi>most Catholike,</hi> haue no vſe but only in comparing truth and ſincerity of faith.

This is a matter of great weight, and we require ſome good authority and proofe for it, that what Chriſt prayed for the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> the ſame he hath prayed for the Pope alſo. But in the proofe of this he faileth wholy, neither can he any way perſwade it vnleſſe he meete with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimple or well-willing creditors, who will bee content for payment to take counters in ſteede of gold. And yet I would further aske him what faith it was whereof Chriſt prayed in the behalfe of <hi>Peter</hi> that the ſame might not faile? Surely by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auſtins</hi> application formerly mentioned, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that it was meant of that faith which is <note n="n" place="margin">Tit 1. 1.</note>

Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> will needs vnderſtand it that Chriſt praied for <hi>Peter</hi> that he might be free from errour in iudgement of faith; then not to queſtion whether <hi>Peter</hi> thenceforth committed any errour in iudgment, it muſt needs be that the Pope cannot be ſubiect to errour in that behalfe. But they themſelues confeſſe that the Pope as a priuate man may erre, that hee may be an Heretike and defend hereſie; only in his Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall ſentence and Pontificall decree hee cannot erre. Was this then the intent of Chriſts prayer in the behalfe of <hi>Peter,</hi> that howſoeuer he might otherwiſe be an Hypocrite or an Heretike, yet when he ſhould ſet himſelfe down in his chaire to define any matter, hee ſhould bee like <hi>Balaam</hi> to bleſſe where hee meaneth to curſe, and like <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to propheſie without vnderſtanding what he ſaith?

                        <hi>To this Church,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe of her more potent principality, it is neceſſary for euery Church to accord, that is, the faithfull euery where, wherein the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:653:24"/> Tradition which came from the Apoſtles hath beene alwaies preſerued.</hi> Now take this reaſon added by <hi>Ireneus</hi> which by <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> is concealed, and it will plainly appeare why it was neceſſary for other Churches to accorde with the Church of Rome. For this Church for the renowme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſneſſe of the place, being then the ſeate of the Empire, was the moſt eminent Church in the world, and therefore continuing ſtill in the doctrine of the Apoſtles without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or change, it was moſt fit of all other to be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a patterne to other Churches, whereto to conforme themſelues; and with which whoſoeuer accordeth not, did thereby ſwarue from the doctrine of the Apoſtles. But the caſe is now altered, becauſe the Church of Rome it ſelfe is now queſtioned for ſwaruing from the Tradition of the Apoſtles; which being ſo, that cannot be ſaid to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now, which was neceſſary ſo long as ſhee continued in that Tradition. And thus ſarre we finde only a neceſſity of conſenting then in doctrine with the Church of Rome, but for her <hi>ſuperiority in gouernement</hi> wee finde nothing. Yes, ſaith <hi>M. Biſhop,</hi> for <hi>Ireneus</hi> attributeth to the Church of Rome, <hi>a mightier or more potent principality,</hi> which what ſhould it import, will he ſay, but a ſuperiority of Dominion and gouernment ouer all other Churches? But I anſwer him, that <hi>principality</hi> doth not enforce ſoueraignty and dominion; for he himſelfe is holden for <hi>a principall man</hi> amongſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Prieſts, and yet hee hath no rule or dominion ouer them. Principality importeth <hi>ſpecialty and chiefty,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth an honour of eſtimation and account, and thus the Church of Rome though hauing no title of dominion for ruling and gouerning, yet had the honour to bee a chiefe and principall aboue other Churches. Now <hi>principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is alwayes <hi>potent,</hi> and they that are chiefe and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent aboue others ſway much by their example and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and their very names are very auailable to induce other, whom notwithſtanding they haue no authority to command, according to that which <hi>Hilary</hi> ſaith, that <note n="q" place="margin">Hilar.

                     <p>HEre is a new-found diſtinction, and I confeſſe my ſelfe to be one of thoſe Doctors that know it not, and wee ſee that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> as great a Doctor as he is, yet can bring neither Scripture, nor Father, nor Councell, nor Story, nor any ancient writer whatſoeuer for the warrant of it, but ſuch as it is wee muſt take it barely vpon his owne word. The Church of Rome hath abuſed the world vnder pretence of the name of the Catholike Church, alleaging falſly of it ſelfe that which is truly ſaid of the Catholike Church, that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church there is no ſaluation.</hi> To diſcouer this fraude we inſtruct men, as truth is, that the Church of Rome is but a particular Church, and therefore cannot be called the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, that is, the vniuerſall Church; and therefore againe that it is but a meere mockery of Popiſh impoſtours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſay that out <hi>of the Church,</hi> meaning the Church <hi>of Rome, there is no ſaluation.</hi> To this <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> anſwereth, that in that propoſition, <hi>The Church of Rome is a particular Church,</hi> there is <hi>doubling and deceipt.</hi> And how I pray? <hi>Forſooth, albeit the Church of Rome in rigour of ſpeech doe comprehend only the Chriſtians dwelling in Rome, yet it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually taken to ſignifie all Churches of other Countries, agreeing in faith with the Church of Rome, and confeſsing the Pope to be chiefe Paſtor of the whole Church.</hi> Where it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued how hee ſetteth himſelfe meerely to circumuent and coſen his Reader. For it being admitted that <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> is taken to ſignifie all Churches of other Countries,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:653:32"/> agreeing in faith with the Church of Rome, and confeſſing the Popes chiefty ouer them, yet this nothing hindereth, but that the Church of Rome is ſtill a particular Church or a part only of the Church, becauſe the whole Church doth not agree nor euer hath agreed to giue to the Pope and Church of Rome that chiefty which they require. For how many Churches are there not in Europe only, but alſo in Aſia and Africa, that deride that claime of theirs, and neither yeeld nor acknowledge any ſuch ſuperiority to belong vnto them? Yea and his owne inſtance of the Roman Empire confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him in this behalfe, becauſe as the Roman Empire was not the Empire of the whole world, but imported only the Countries ſubiect to the Romans; there being many other Dominions and Kingdomes that were neuer ſubiect vnto them; euen ſo the Roman Church is not the Church of the whole world, which is the Catholike Church, but ſignifieth only thoſe Churches which profeſſe ſubiection to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, there being many other Churches which profeſſe no ſuch ſubiection. Now therefore be it ſo, that <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> is ſo vſually taken to ſignifie <hi>other Churches,</hi> ſubmitting themſelues to the Church of Rome, <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> for all this to his purpoſe is neuer a whit the nearer, vnleſſe he can ſhew that <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> is taken to ſignifie the whole Catholike Church of Chriſt. For if it be not the whole Catholike Church, then it is but a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and part thereof, and therefore only a particular Church. Tell vs then, <hi>M. Biſhop,</hi> is it any where to be found that <hi>the Roman Church</hi> is taken to ſignifie the whole Catholike Church? Marke, I pray thee, gentle Reader, how it ſticketh betwixt his teeth. Faine hee would ſpeake it, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee knoweth it to bee an abſurd lye, his heart faileth him, and only faintly hee telleth vs, <hi>The whole Catholike Church may be called the Roman Church.</hi> But <hi>M.

And therefore it is nothing to vs what they by abuſe of ſpeech teach their followers to ſay; let their French Diſciples ſay <hi>they are of the Catholike Roman Church;</hi> we vnderſtand them thereby to take part with the Church of Rome, but the Church of Rome is that of Rome only whereto they addict themſelues.

                        <hi>Chriſtian is my name, and Catholike my ſurname;</hi> but that is changed now into <hi>Roman Catholike is my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,</hi> diſclaiming thereby the communion and fellowſhip of the Catholike Church, and banding themſelues in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and factious confederacy with the Roman Church. Thus hauing departed from the ancient faith and diſcipline of the Catholike Church, they doe notwithſtanding for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring of their Apoſtaſie, retaine certaine names and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities thereof, but they doe it ſo as that by their additions and conſtructions they make no other but mungrels and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards of them. And this appeareth by the reaſon that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> giueth of their adding <hi>Roman to Catholike,</hi> namely <hi>to ſeparate them that ioyne in faith with the Church of Rome from other ſectaries;</hi> becauſe Catholikes were of old ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not for ioyning in faith with this or that Church, but for being members of the vniuerſall Church. And if that reaſon were ſufficient, it ſhould haue waighed of old as well as now, when there were ſo many Sects and Hereſies in the Church, when Schiſmatikes and Heretikes vſurped to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the name of Catholikes, and yet the Catholike ſaw no reaſon to draw the whole to the name of any part, or to call themſelues otherwiſe then by the name of Catholikes, as reſoluing to profeſſe no other communion or fellowſhip, but vniuerſally with the Church of the whole world. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it otherwiſe till Antichriſt had exalted himſelfe in the Roman Sea, who challenging to himſelfe and his only to bee the Church of God, tooke vpon him to ſet his owne marke vpon the Church, to call it <hi>the Catholike Roman Church,</hi> and the members thereof <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:653:34"/> that none ſhould thenceforth bee called <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,</hi> but ſuch as would bee called <hi>Roman Catholikes.</hi> And hereof <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> very rightly ſaith, that <hi>hereby they ſeparate thoſe Catholikes that ioyne in faith with the Church of Rome from other ſectaries;</hi> as importing them alſo to bee Sectaries that ioyne in faith with the Church of Rome, and that by this marke they are to bee knowen from <hi>other Sectaries.</hi> For certaine it is that the name of <hi>Roman Catholike</hi> is a name of Sect and Schiſme, and an open proclaiming of a rent and diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Catholike Church of Chriſt. Now for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this paſſage hee telleth vs, that <hi>out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes may bee gathered, that the Roman Church may well ſignifie any Church, holding the ſame faith which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth.</hi> But what <hi>premiſes</hi> may wee thinke hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth here? Surely if this bee his concluſion, wee finde here nothing but concluſion; <hi>premiſes</hi> to proue it wee finde none. Hee hath told vs before that it <hi>may bee ſo,</hi> and here full wiſely hee repeateth the ſame againe, but neither before nor here doth hee ſay any thing whereof it ſhould <hi>bee gathered</hi> that it <hi>may</hi> bee ſo. And though it may be ſo, yet it auaileth him nothing as hath beene ſaid, becauſe it is but a part of the Church that ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in faith with the Church of Rome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Roman Church cannot bee ſaid to bee the whole Catholike Church; ſo that my propoſition ſtill ſtandeth good, <hi>the Church of Rome is a particular Church,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Biſhop</hi> though hee bee a Doctor that ſometimes vnderſtandeth what hee ſpeaketh, yet is not ſo great a Doctor in this point as that hee can giue vs any reaſon why hee ought otherwiſe to vnderſtand.</p>

Let it bee that property of a head which he mentioneth, and which I intended as meant by them, that all other Churches are <hi>to bee directed and gouerned</hi> by the authority of the Church of Rome, as the members of the body by the head; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my argument ſhall proceede, that <hi>the Church of Rome by their learning is the head of all other Churches, and all other Churches are as the members and body to this head; but the Catholike Church comprehendeth all, euen the whole both head and body.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this compariſon betwixt the Donatiſts and the Papiſts, I muſt confeſſe that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome little ouer-ſight by vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that generally of the Donatiſts which belonged only to a part of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by affirming that wholly of Cartenna in Mauritania, which is to be referred to that which properly and particularly is called Africa. I obſerued the errour my ſelfe long ſince, and meant in another edition, if any ſhould be, to correct it; and in the meane time to haue noted it in the Preface of my third part. But now ſince it falleth out to be firſt noted by <hi>M. Biſhop,</hi> I will take it here in his due place, making it to appeare that this miſtaking in a circumſtance altereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſubſtance of that compariſon which I had there in hand. The firſt branch then of the compariſon ſhall bee this; <hi>The Donatiſts did ſet vp a particular Church to be the Catholike Church; all of them firſt in the ſouth of Africa, ſome of them afterwards,</hi> namely, <hi>the Rogatiſts, at Cartenna in Mauritania, and ſo haue the Papiſts done at Rome in Italie.</hi> Againſt this branch as it was before ſet downe, hee giueth two exceptions. Firſt, <hi>that they doe not hold it ſo to be at Rome a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> the Rogatiſts did at Cartenna.</hi> And what is the difference? Marry, <hi>they hold it to be ſo at Rome, as that it is diſperſed alſo all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:653:38"/> the world ouer, but the Rogatiſts held it to be wholly inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the bounds of Cartenna and confines thereof.</hi> The firſt part of which anſwere on their owne behalfe is falſe, and the ſecond part thereof concerning the Rogatiſts is vaine. For it is falſe that hee ſaith that their Romiſh Church is diſperſed all the world ouer, and hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well that the Churches of Greece and all the Eaſterne Churches are holden by them to be Schiſmatikes, becauſe they diſclaime ſubiection to the Church of Rome. True it is, they would haue it all the world ouer, and they make ſimple fooles beleeue that it is ſo, but they themſelues know that the skirts of it are too ſhort to reach ſo farre, and that a huge part of the Church there is that will haue nothing to doe with them. And this drew from <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> that caution that I before mentioned in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <note n="a" place="margin">Supra. cap. 1. §. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>though one only Prouince did imbrace the true faith, yet the ſame ſhould truly and properly be called the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, ſo long as it could bee plainly ſhewed that it is one and the ſame with that which at any time or times was ouer the whole world.</hi> Now hereof it followeth that the other part of his exception concerning the Rogatiſts is vaine. For although the communion of the Church of Rome be farre larger then that was of the Rogatiſts at Cartenna, yet doth neither of them containe any more but a part, and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as touching their communion ſorteth all to one. For whereas <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> ſaith that the Rogatiſts included the Church within the bounds of Cartenna and the Countrey thereabout, it was not by poſition of doctrine that they ſo included it as if it could not be any where elſe; but becauſe they pretended that the Church was only in their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and there were none in any other part of the world that tooke part with them, it followeth of this defect that they ſo included it.

                        <hi>hoping that the Donatiſts would thinke it more meete and more eaſie that their part ſhould be reconciled to the whole world, then that the whole world ſhould be rebaptized by them,</hi> it appeareth plainly that their opinion did not exclude the hauing of their communion throughout the whole world. It remained therefore that Africa was to be as it were the head and foundation of their Catholike Church, and from thence the Church through the world was to bee renued and reſtored againe by holding communion and fellowſhip with that Church. Euen in the ſame ſort ſtandeth the matter with the Papiſts, who tell vs that the Church in all the farre parts of the world hath fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; that <note n="k" place="margin">Rhem.

                        </note> the Patriarchall and Apoſtolike Seas are all either extinguiſhed, or by Schiſme and Hereſie fallen away, and only the Roman Church hath remained, wherein only is the communion of the Catholike faith, and whence the Church through the whole world is to be reedified and reduced to the obedience of the Pope. And to that purpoſe they tell vs of ſtrange wonders that they haue done, and make as if they had conuerted whole worlds of nations to their Roman faith, when as indeede they doe but mocke the world with lies and tales, talking liberally of Countries whither they know it vnlikely for vs to come to ſearch out whether they ſpeake truth or not; and the nations which they pretend to haue conuerted being either colonies of their owne people tranſported thither, or ſome Inſidels forced to accept bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme without religion, or ſuch as by wiles they haue ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make profit of by trafficke and merchandiſe, as in Iaponia the Ieſuits moſt lewdly and trecherouſly haue done. Thus then <hi>M.

Auguſtine <hi>in both places, who expreſly deliuereth, that it was for the fulneſſe of Sacraments,</hi> Ex plenitudine Sacramento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,<note place="margin">Breui collat. cap. 2. dici 3.

Auguſtine <hi>obſerueth) then to goe about to proue</hi> vniuerſality by perfection, <hi>which is not vniuerſall. But ſeeing well that they could not defend their congregation to be Catholike, (that is, vniuerſall) but by ſome kinde of vniuerſality; they defended it to be ſo called, for the vniuerſality and fulneſſe of Sacraments and Commandements, that is: becauſe their Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the Sacraments that the Catholikes did, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to keepe all Gods Commandements as fully as they.</hi> M. Abbots <hi>former fault then in this ſecond point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance (and that a foule one) is, in that he belieth the Donatiſts. And more palpably ſhould he haue belyed the Roman Church, if hee had iuſtly brought in the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, to wit: if he had ſaid as due proportion required,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:653:40"/> that we hold our Church to be Catholike as the Donatists did theirs,</hi> for the perfection of doctrine and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>which is ſo manifeſtly vntrue, and ſo clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doctrine of all Catholike writers, that he (that was wont to bluſh at nothing) ſeemeth yet aſhamed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch it openly; and yet doth at laſt traile it in deceitfully. As for perfection of doctrine and Sacraments, though it be only in the Catholike Church; yet it is ſo farre wide from the ſignification and vſe of the word Catholike, that none (except ſuch wiſe-men as</hi> M.

                        <hi>they were found to be ſtuffed with vaine errours of ſuperſtitions, and that many counterfaite praiers were inſerted into them vnder falſe and counterfaite names of Saints.</hi> Of theſe errours and ſuperſtitions they reformed what they liſt, and purged their bookes and Seruice of many things that were amiſſe: and what? will any man ſay hereupon that they became another Church? We proceeded further and voided the Church of the reſt of thoſe abhominations, which igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:653:51"/> and errour had brought in, which they were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to haue medled with, becauſe the ſame were gainfull to them; and ſhall we be ſaid hereupon to deny that there was any viſible Church before, and to beginne a new Church? No, we ſay that the Church hath continued ſtill from the time that it was firſt planted; we affirme it to haue been the houſe of God, the garden and vineyard of the Lord, but we ſay that the husbandmen had long dealt wickedly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfully in the vſage of it; they dreſt not the Lords vine but ſuffered it to grow wild; they let this garden be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growen with briars and weedes, and Foxes and Swine had liberty to tread it downe and to deſtroy it. All that we haue done hath beene but to loppe and prune the vine, to dreſſe and water the garden that lay waſt, to plucke vp the weedes and thornes, to driue out the noyſome beaſts, and to repaire the fence that they may be kept out. Therefore, we doe not take vpon vs to be another Church, but the ſame Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, neither haue we gone about to bring in a new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but only to reforme that which they call the old, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill the ſame Scriptures which they acknowledged, the ſame articles of faith, the ſame Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Supper of the Lord, the ſame forme of diuine Seruice, ſaue only that we haue cut off what their ſuperſtition had brought in contrary to the word of God, and practiſe of the firſt Church. Many goodly ſtones and pillars of Chriſtian doctrine there were remayning amongſt them, which we continue and acknowledge according to the word of Chriſt, and whereby we cannot doubt but that in thoſe times of darkeneſſe many found meanes to ſee the light of God, and were thereby directed vnto eternall life. Farre therefore are we from Donatiſme, who neither affirme the periſhing of the Church in any part of the world, no not in Rome it ſelfe, nor tie it to any one place as the Papiſts doe to Rome, nor hang it vpon the necke of any one man as they doe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Popes necke; but acknowledge all nations and all men indifferently accepted with God, accordingly as in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:653:52"/> and truth they faithfully worſhip him. The ſecond point of the Donatiſts hereſie he nameth this, <hi>that they rebaptized Catholikes that fell into their ſect.</hi> His application is, <hi>Though all the Proteſtants doe not rebaptize, yet one part of them, to wit, the Anabaptiſts doe vſe it.</hi> But his foolery in that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no anſwere, it being knowen to himſelfe that the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts are exploded and deteſted vniuerſally of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches. The Anabaptiſts ſhall be rather theirs then ours. And whereas he diuideth the Proteſtants into Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Sacramentaries and Anabaptiſts, as anſwerable to the Donatiſts, Rogatiſts and Maximianiſts, he ſhould rather haue made the like diuiſion of Papiſts into Anabaptiſts, Seculariſts, and Ieſuitiſts; the Anabaptiſts anſwering the Rogatiſts in challenging the Church from the reſt of the body of their Schiſme only to themſelues; the Seculariſts and Ieſuitiſts ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſembling the Donatiſts and Maximianiſts, each diuided for a time by mortall quarrell amongſt themſelues, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent after a while as men of one Church and religion to bee reconciled againe. The third point that he mentioneth is this, <hi>They held not the faith of the bleſſed Trinity entire and whole, but ſome of them taught like Arians, the ſonne to be leſſe then the father, though as</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Auſtin <hi>noteth this was not marked of their followers.</hi> This he applyeth to vs in this ſort, <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, diuers of their principall teachers, as</hi> Melanchton, Caluin, <hi>and many others doe corrupt the ſound doctrine of the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity, as I haue ſhewed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the Preface of the Reformation of a deformed Catholike, though the common ſort of them doe not greatly obſerue it.</hi> In which third point he very wilfully belyeth both S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austin</hi> and the Donatiſts and vs. For S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austin</hi> doth not ſay of the Donatiſts, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a ſecond <hi>Donatus,</hi> who was a follower of the former, that <note n="o" place="margin">Auguſt. ad Quodvult. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. 69. <hi>Apparet cum etiam non Catholicam de Trinitate babu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe ſententiam, &amp;c.

Forſooth, <hi>for plucking downe of Churches, abuſing the moſt bleſſed Sacrament, holy Oiles, and all holy ornaments that belonged to Catholikes Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Proteſtants are not behinde, but goe farre beyond the Donatiſts.</hi> But this I let paſſe as another part of his idle bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, only telling him that to fit the example of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellions, he ſhould rather haue looked to thoſe memorable acts that haue beene done by the Leaguers and Ieſuits, and other madde-braines of their imployment in France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, Poland, and in all places almoſt of Chriſtendome, where they haue gotten any ſtrength, whereof goodly ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries might be here ſet downe if it were pertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the maine point that we haue now in hand. In the laſt thing which he noteth of the Donatiſts, he ſpecially ſheweth his great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of little wit, the matter whereto he alludeth being
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:653:53"/> ſuch as whence I might moſt iuſtly haue taken yet a further reſemblance betwixt the Donatiſts and them. <hi>Finally,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Donatiſts deuiſed a new kinde of Pſalmes to be ſung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their diuine Seruice and Sermons.</hi> And what the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants? Forſooth, <hi>they haue alſo compounded and framed a new kinde of Pſalmes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>called Geneua Pſalmes, to be ſung before their Sermons. A new kinde of Pſalmes,</hi> ſay you, <hi>M. Biſhop?</hi> What? doe not you know that thoſe <hi>Geneua pſalmes,</hi> as you call them, are only the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> and other Prophets and holy Men, tranſlated into Engliſh Meter, and doe they ſeeme to you a new kinde of Pſalmes? They were turned into Meter and Verſe, and fitted with plaine and eaſie notes and tunes, to ſerue for popular and common vſe of Chriſtian exerciſe and edification, both in our Churches and priuate houſes, that we may anſwere the exhortation of the Apoſtle, <note n="r" place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:653:55"/> of the Corinthians done to you? What I ſay of it, I would haue to be vnderſtood of all ſuch and as farre diſtant Churches; what haue they done vnto you? &amp;c.</hi> with all which the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts were at as great ſquare as they were with the Church of Rome, and yet <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> will not yeeld to any of them any prorogatiue thereby. But all mention of the Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem and the reſt, he thought it behouefull for him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, becauſe if he had ſet it downe he knew well that the Reader would eaſily ſee that in all this great ſhew hee had ſaid nothing. And by the premiſes it appeareth that he hath ſaid as little in producing the wordes of <hi>Optatus;</hi> for be it that the Donatiſts did then cruelly wage battell againſt the Church of Rome, and there were no agreement betwixt them, what is that to that that I ſay concerning the Church of Rome now? what hindereth that, I ſay ſtill, but that there may be now a iuſt reſemblance betwixt the Papiſts and the Donatiſts? His concluſion therefore is ridiculous, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith that <hi>Cecilianus</hi> needed not to care for the Donatiſts, ſo long as he ſaw himſelfe ioyned with the church of Rome, therefore they neede not to care ſo long as they ſtand in <hi>the like ſociety of faith and religion with the ſame Church of Rome.</hi> For ſeeing the Church of Rome is not the ſame now that it was then, as in the proceſſe of this booke, God willing, ſhall plainly appeare, there may be iuſt cauſe in many things now to forſake the communion of the church of Rome, though it were piety and religion to hold it then. But it is not to be omitted how falſly he dealeth here againe, in alleaging the wordes of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as if he ſpake of being ioyned with the Church of Rome only, whereas he nameth other Churches as well as the Church of Rome. <note n="f" place="margin">Aug.

The name of <hi>Iew</hi> importing of old a prerogatiue of being the people of God, and of hauing the knowledge of God and of true religion, was a name of honorable reſpect, as I haue ſhewed, and therein the name of <hi>Catholike</hi> is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to it, hauing beene wont to ſignifie the true profeſſors of Chriſtian faith, liuing in the vnity and fellowſhip of one Catholike Church, being thereby partakers of the honour that belongeth to the ſame Church. The name of <hi>Iew</hi> though in it ſelfe a gracious and louely name, yet by the infidelity and apoſtaſie of them who for carnall propagation only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it to themſelues, without regard of the ſpirituall duty thereto annexed, became a name of <hi>curſe</hi> and reproch. What hindereth but that I might alſo ſay, the thing being ſo, that <hi>the name of Catholikes</hi> alſo, though honorable and deſireable in it ſelfe, and in that vſe whereto it was of old ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, yet being abuſed by vniuſt vſurpers of it, is in them and in their abuſe a name of curſe and infamie, ſo as that when we heare ſuch a man call himſelfe <hi>a Catholike,</hi> we take him thereby to be a man of ſhame, and to carry the marke of an Apoſtata and an Heretike. Yea but <hi>the law of the Iewes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was to continue but for a time, and to end at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, whereas the name of Catholike ſhall neuer faile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> It is true that the law of the Iewes as touching the outward ceremonies was to end at the comming of Chriſt, but in the ſpirituall vſe and doctrine thereof accompliſhed in Chriſt, it was to remaine for euer. Wherein if the Iewes had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by faith, their name and they themſelues had continued

                        <hi>by vnbeliefe they were broken off,</hi> and thereby their name grew to that deteſtation ſpoken of.

For with them <hi>a Catholike</hi> is no otherwiſe taken but for <hi>a Roman Catholike;</hi> and becauſe the whole Church is not <hi>Roman</hi> but a part only, what is this Roman Catholike, but one who vnder the falſe name of a Catholike diuideth himſelfe from the whole Church, as the Donatiſts did, to cleaue to a part thereof?

                  <p>BVt (<hi>and it pleaſe you</hi>) the Proteſtants haue the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell of the name Catholike, and we but the ſhell. <hi>Why doe they then ſo bitterly inueigh againſt it? why are they not more willing to extoll and magnifie that renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med title, being of ſuch ancient Nobility? Twenty pound to a peny, that what face ſoeuer he ſet on it, yet in his heart he meruailouſly feareth the contrary himſelfe. If that faith and religion only be Catholike and Vniuerſall (as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth) that hath euer beene, and is alſo ſpread ouer all the world, and ſhall continue to the worlds end; then ſurely their religion cannot be Catholike, euen by the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme confeſsion of themſelues: who generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that for nine hundred yeares togither, the Papacy did ſo domineer all the world ouer, that not a man of their religion was to be found in any corner of the world, that durſt peepe out his head to contradict it. Could there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church of theirs then, when there was not one Pastor and flocke of their religion (though neuer ſo ſmall) in any one Countrey? And euen now when their Goſpell is at the hotteſt, hath it ſpread it ſelfe all the world ouer? is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in Italie, Spaine, Greece, Afrike, or Aſia, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Indians? nothing leſſe.

As for your wager, <hi>M. Biſhop, of twenty pound to a peny,</hi> you haue loſt it, and you know that you haue loſt it, becauſe you ſee that I haue ſet no other face vpon the matter then by ſufficient proofs I haue made good. But here he taketh in hand to bereaue vs of the kernell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our faith and religion was neuer Catholike, that is, was neuer ſpred ouer the whole world. Whereas I on the other ſide doe tell him, that it is only our religion which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to haue beene abſolutely ſpred ouer all the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:653:66"/> and none but ours. For our religion is no more nor other then is contained in the Goſpels and Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, and becauſe we know that the religion there ſet downe was ſpred ouer all the world, therefore we cannot doubt but that our religion is that, that was ſpred ouer all the world, and though Apoſtaſie hath ouerſhadowed it, yet hath euer ſince continued in the world. As for that which he alleageth to the contrary, it is no <hi>vniforme confeſsion</hi> of ours, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed lye of his owne. We doe not acknowledge that <hi>for nine hundred yeares togither there was not a man of our religion to be found in the world.</hi> The Papacy indeede did mightily <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer</hi> accordingly as it was foretold, but yet it could neuer ſo preuaile to the extirpation of our religion, but that euen in the middeſt of the Papacy it hath continued ſtill; yea thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and hundred thouſands, as by their owne ſtories ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, haue beene murthered and ſlaine for the profeſſion thereof. Yea in the very religion of Popery our religion hath continued; for what is Popery, but a doctrine compounded of our religion, and their owne deuice? Our religion hath ſerued them for a foundation, whereupon to build, not only their wood, and hay, and ſtubble, but alſo the wild-fire and poiſon of their idolatries and damnable hereſies, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the pretence and colour of our religion, Chriſtian eares would haue deteſted and abhorred, but therefore dreaded them not, becauſe they ſaw them cloaked with ſhew of ſtill retaining that which we profeſſe. They durſt not deny thoſe Canonicall bookes of the old and new Teſtament, which our religion receiueth, but to ſerue their turne they added other bookes not inſpired of God, to be notwithſtanding of like authority with thoſe. They acknowledged the Lords praier, the articles of the Creede, the ten Commandements, which we receiue as principles of our religion, but they fruſtrated them by a ſuperſtitious cuſtome brought in of reciting them like a charme in an vnknowen tongue. They haue neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the two Sacraments which we teach, which were faſt rooted in Chriſtian profeſſion; but they haue added to them
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:653:67"/> other fiue, and made them vp ſeuen. They vſed no other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall forme of Baptiſme then we doe; only they propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it with ſundry polluted and corrupt ceremonies of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane deuice. In their Maſſe and Sacrament of the Altar, the ground of all is that that we doe according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, and example of the primitiue Church. They bring bread and wine to the Lords table, they ſanctifie or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the ſame with the words of Chriſt; when and where they liſt they adminiſter the ſame to the people, and all this they take vpon them to doe in remembrance of the Paſſion, Death, and Reſurrection of our Lord Ieſus. This is our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and herein their example iuſtifieth vs; but their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of tranſubſtantiation, and reall preſence, and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy, and ſacrifice propitiatory for quicke and dead, with the reſt of that kinde, are additions of theirs, whereof the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt which togither with vs they recite, maketh no ſhew at all. If they ſhould haue diſclaimed redemption and remiſſion of ſinnes, by the bloud-ſhed and death of Chriſt, Chriſtian people would haue defied them; therefore they left the name thereof in the Church, which is our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but they defeated the power of it by bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is our religion to acknowledge Chriſt to be the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man, and this they would neuer diſauow; but to Chriſt they haue ioyned the Saints alſo to be our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators. It is our religion to teach that God is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, and all ſpirituall deuotion is to be done vnto him, and this they cannot deny: but they haue added hereto the worſhipping of Saints and Saints Images, and thereby haue defiled the worſhip of the immortall God. They deny not grace which our religion teacheth, but they put to it the power of nature and free will. They dare not but confeſſe Chriſt to be the head of the Church, which our religion teacheth; but they haue added the Pope to be another head, and ſo haue made the Church a Monſter with two heads.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:653:67"/> Thus in euery point of doctrine take away thoſe patcheries and additions of theirs, which are things not taught vs by the word of God, and euen in their religion that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth is our religion, the very truth of the Goſpell of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. For theſe and ſuch other propoſitions of true faith the Diuell could neuer aboliſh out of the Church; only by Antichriſt he ſuppreſſed the knowledge and vſe of them, and to this wholſome wine put ſuch abundance of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and poiſoned waters, as might fruſtrate the power and effect thereof. Wherein notwithſtanding he could not ſo farre preuaile, but that the light here and there brake forth by ſuch chinks and lattiſes as were remaining, which many of our forefathers in the time of that Aegyptian darkeneſſe, did diſcerne and ſee to their euerlaſting comfort and ſoules health. Yea <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> knoweth well that there were in thoſe times both Paſtors and Flocks, not in one only Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but in many, who deteſted thoſe blendings and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of theirs, and kept themſelues either wholly or for the moſt part to the entire truth of our religion, the light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euen then ſhined vnto them out of the very darkeneſſe of the Church. Which notwithſtanding we wonder not that he pretendeth not to know, who will ſeeme not to know that our religion hath ſpred it ſelfe into Italie and Spaine, when as all the world knoweth that the Inquiſition hath ſhed the bloud of many thouſands there only for the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our religion. Yea the principles of our religion are ſo reſiding, will they, nill they, in the very bowels of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that they are forced to vſe many ſiniſter courſes to drowne and ſtifle them, and to keepe the people from taking knowledge thereof, becauſe they ſee that if there be but winde to blow away the aſhes, our fire will ſtraightwaies burne amongſt them, and the flame preſently aſcend to the conſuming of their roofe; they ſee that if men be but ſtirred a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

Why did he not rather ſhew, that their new Goſpell flouriſhed in all Countries aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as the Chriſtian faith was planted, and that it hath continued in all ages ſince the Apoſtles dayes, vntill our time? that had beene to haue ſpoken directly to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which he ſeldome vſeth.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:653:71"/> If the Catholike Church be but one from the beginning to the end, and of this Church from the beginning to the end there be but one faith, as hath beene ſhewed, who is ſo blind as that he ſeeth not that the Catholike faith now muſt be the ſame with the faith of all the Patriarchs and Fathers ſince the world beganne? It was not <hi>Catholike</hi> then, becauſe it was peculiar only to ſome few whom God enlightened, or to one only nation which he ſpecially ſelected, but it was the very ſame which afterwards became Catholike by being preached and ſpred ouer the whole world. Now then moſt cleare it is that if our faith be the ſame with the faith of <hi>Abel,</hi> of <hi>Enoch,</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe times, then our faith is the Catholike faith, euen the faith which the Apoſtles preached through the world; and if the faith of Popery be not the ſame, then is Popery falſly termed the Catholike faith. <hi>M.

                     <p>I Gaue inſtance in mine anſwere of ſundry points of faith and religion, which I affirmed to bee vnknowen to the firſt Fathers; which notwithſtanding are ſuch as they could not haue beene ignorant of, if they were matters of ſo great moment in religion, as they are pretended now. I named <hi>the worſhipping of Idols and Images, Inuocation of Saints and Angels, Merits and ſupererogations, Monkiſh vowes, Popiſh pardons, and prayers for ſoules in Purgatory, Pilgrimages to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and dead mens bones, auricular Confeſsion and ſhrift,</hi> in which and ſundry other ſuch like deuices, the very ſubſtance of Catholike religion is now with the Papiſts imagined to conſiſt. Now <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> affirmeth to the contrary, <hi>that they held the moſt of theſe; the most,</hi> he ſaith, not all; thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting concerning ſome of them, at leaſt that they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to them. And yet as though hee wiſt not what hee had ſaid, he taketh in hand <hi>to touch euery one of my inſtances,</hi> and to giue ſome proofe of euery one of them, <hi>referring the Reader for more full ſatisfaction, to the proper places of the head controuerſies,</hi> whereas he knoweth well that in the anſwere to thoſe controuerſies is already taken away almoſt all that he hath here ſaid. As firſt, his exception againſt the name of Idoll, <note n="a" place="margin">Of Images, ſect. 5.</note> I haue ſhewed to be wholly vaine, and haue made it plaine out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others, that euery Image con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to be worſhipped, is properly an Idoll.

I ſay that the old Fathers worſhipped no Images; and he to proue the contrary alleageth that in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Temple they had Images. What is the one of theſe to the other? Be it that they had them, but doth it thereof
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:653:78"/> follow that they worſhipped them? Doth he not know that ſome of our men doe defend the hauing of Images in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet doe hold it groſſe idolatry to worſhip Images? It is written in the Pſalme, <hi>Adore yee his foote-ſtoole,</hi> but what is that to Images? Doth it any where appeare that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages are Gods foote-ſtoole; or that there were in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or Temple any Images that went vnder that name?

Where yet further in deriſion hee addeth,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>And turne thee to any of the Saints; as if by way of despight he ſaid, Thou canſt not finde the Saints thy helpers in affliction, whom thou wouldeſt not haue for thy companions in thy mirth and welfare.</hi> In a word, we finde not in the words that <hi>Iob</hi> was counſailed to pray to Saints, neither doe we finde it any where elſe that <hi>Iob</hi> followed any ſuch counſell, neither is there any example of any other of thoſe Fathers that they did ſo, and therefore neither in this can <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> finde their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the Fathers. The next matter is concerning Merit and Free-will, for which he bringeth two texts which are already wreſted from him, being by himſelfe <note n="ſ" place="margin">Of Free-will Sect. 10. 11.</note> before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and by me fully anſwered. But yet obſerue brieſly how well they make for that for which he alleageth them. <hi>If thou doe well,</hi> ſaith God to Cain, <hi>ſhalt thou not receiue?</hi> His argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hence muſt be this: He that doth well, ſhall receiue; therefore he meriteth that which he ſhall receiue. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, becauſe that which he receiueth is of the bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the giuer, not of the merit or deſert of workes, as through the whole queſtion <hi>of merits</hi> I haue declared at large. Such is his other argument from thoſe wordes of Moſes; <note n="t" place="margin">Deut. 30. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>I haue ſet before you life and death; chooſe life that thou maieſt liue, by louing the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi> For God
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:653:80"/> thus ſetting life before vs, doth not tell vs what we by right deſerue, but what it is his pleaſure to giue to thoſe that loue and obey him. We chooſe life by louing the Lord our God, and obeying him, and cleauing vnto him; but in all this wee doe but our duty, and cannot preſume to merit any thing thereby. No better ſucceſſe hath he for Free-will, albeit in that manner as he propoundeth it, we deny it not, for wee grant that <hi>man hath by Gods grace free-will to doe good works;</hi> we deny only that free-will which they hold as a power of nature, and not the effect of the grace of God, whereby man himſelfe doth ſomething for himſelfe beſide that which God doth. We doe well; who denyeth it? but it is only of the grace of God that we doe well. We chooſe life, it is true; but it is of the gift of God that we chooſe life; <note n="u" place="margin">Auguſt. de Praedeſt. ſanct. cap. 10. <hi>Ipſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit vt illi ſaciant quae praecepit.</hi>

                        <hi>Who maketh vs to doe thoſe things,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Auſtin, <hi>which he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done.</hi> As for that which <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> ſaith, that <hi>power is giuen to the wicked to doe well if they will,</hi> it is an abſurd ſpeech, becauſe they cannot <hi>will</hi> till God worke in them to will, neither can they haue any power to doe well, vntill they haue the will. For the forbearing of outward hainous acts, we deny not but that God hath left in man, euen in the wicked, ſome power of free-will, elſe in vaine were all lawes and admonitions, neither could there continue any ſociety amongſt men. Be it that the wordes cited by <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> doe yeeld ſo much to <hi>Cain;</hi> but to the conuerting of the heart, to the inward renewing of the ſoule, to the embracing of the loue of righteouſneſſe, to true repentance, faith, obedience, the will of man hath nothing at all but what is wrought in it by the grace of God. But of all theſe things I haue ſpoken ſo fully before, that it is not fit here to ſtand vpon them any more. For workes of ſupererogation he is faine to betake himſelfe to the ceremoniall law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> thereby leauing vs to take it as of his owne confeſſion, that before that time, which was the ſpace of two thouſand and almoſt fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, the Church of God knew no ſuch; and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to conclude, that becauſe they ſtood only in ceremonies
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:653:80"/> which were not meerely for themſelues to bee reckoned in the number of good workes, therefore the ceremoniall law being aboliſhed in Chriſt, thoſe workes of ſupererogation muſt therein haue an end. But the workes of ſupererogation which they maintaine, and whereof I ſpake, are workes of the morall law, the precepts and righteouſneſſe whereof hath concerned the whole Church from the beginning, and before the written law; and therefore which muſt needes haue beene found in the Church from the beginning, if there were in them that righteouſneſſe and perfection, which is now preſumed of them. Of theſe <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> is ſilent; he can ſay nothing, he can ſhew nothing; there is no example, no intimation of any ſuch, beleeued or practiſed in the Church, I will not ſay for two thouſand, as before, but for the ſpace of foure thouſand yeares, as by his owne confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>interpretatiuè</hi> we argue, becauſe he alleageth none. His inſtance of workes of ſupererogation is only in legall vowes, which albeit in the ceremony they were in ſome ſort arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, yet carryed alwaies an implication of ſpirituall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duties which to make their vowes acceptable vnto God were then to be performed by them, and are now ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be performed by vs. The vow of the Nazarite did by certaine obſeruations ſhadow forth, what ought ſpiritually to be the holineſſe and purity of them, who either then were or now are by the calling of the grace of God ſeparated vnto God. And ſo it ſtood with all other vowes, which were of things appointed by the law to bee offered and ſacrificed, which ſerued to aduertiſe both them and vs of that <note n="x" place="margin">Leo in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſar. ſuo. ſer. 3. <hi>Vniuerſi ſpirituales &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionales Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Sacerdotalis officij conſortes, &amp;c.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:653:82"/> for an example of vowing their Monkiſh vowes? As ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly doth he behaue himſelfe in the next point, where I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged of thoſe old Fathers, that <hi>they neither ſold nor bought Pardons.</hi> He anſwereth, <hi>neither they nor we either buy or ſell pardons;</hi> (yet that the Pope doth ſo and vſually hath ſo done, all the world knoweth) but if he would haue ſpoken to the purpoſe, he ſhould haue ſhewed vs that though they neither bought nor ſold Pardons, yet they had Pardons accuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as they haue beene amongſt vs. He ſhould haue made it appeare to vs, if he would haue dealt plainly, that there was then from time to time ſome Pope or <hi>Quaſi-Pope,</hi> that could giue bils of releaſe from Purgatory paines, for the comfort of the ſoules, which he ſaith lie broiling there; or ſith he could not ſo doe, ſhould haue confeſſed ingenuouſly that there was no ſuch matter in thoſe times, neither Pope, nor Purgatory, nor Pardons, and ſo haue left vs to thinke as already we doe, that we may be as well without beleefe of them now, as they were then. As for that which he alleageth of mercy ſhewed to the children for the fathers ſake, and of puniſhment reſerued after the remiſſion of the ſinne, what mad man would haue brought the ſame in the behalfe of the Popes Pardons, but that belike his Reader perforce muſt take it, that he hath giuen me an anſwere, becauſe he ſaith ſomewhat? But of theſe two points, <note n="i" place="margin">Of Merits, ſect 7. Conſut. of the Anſwer to <hi>M.

                        <hi>Let them heare them,</hi> and commeth downe to the latter times of the Iewes, to <hi>Iudas Maccabeus,</hi> or rather to that which an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine ſtory reporteth, concerning <hi>Iudas Maccabeus,</hi> which yet reporteth not that which he taketh vpon him to

                        <hi>Doing well and honeſtly that he thought of the reſurrection; for if he had not hoped that they which were ſlaine ſhould riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it had beene ſuperfluous and vaine to pray for the dead.</hi> That then which <hi>Iudas</hi> did, is ſaid to haue beene done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the reſurrection from the dead, that the ſinne of them which were ſlaine, might not bee imputed vnto them when they ſhould riſe againe. Yea, it is ſaid that that which was done were <hi>ſuperfluous and vaine,</hi> but only in hope of the reſurrection. But though there were no reſurrection, yet prayer for the dead ſhould not bee ſuperfluous and vaine if thereby ſoules were deliuered from Purgatory paines. Therefore, there was no reſpect of Purgatory in that which <hi>Iudas</hi> did. Yea what if that which <hi>Iudas</hi> did were not done for the dead at all, but only for the liuing? Surely for my part I am ſo perſwaded, and I thinke any man that well waigheth the ſtorie, will be of the ſame minde. Peruſe it, gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and thou ſhalt ſee that there is great cauſe to thinke that all that is ſpoken there as touching prayer and offering for the dead, is the hiſtorians Commentarie, and interpretation of the fact of <hi>Iudas,</hi> without any occaſion of ſuch conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giuen by <hi>Iudas</hi> himſelfe. In a battaile ſome few of the Iewes were ſlaine, vnder whoſe coates when they came to bury them, they found iewels conſecrated to Idols, which they were forbidden by the law to meddle with. <hi>Then euery man ſaw,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that this was the cauſe wherefore they were ſlaine, and they gaue thanks to the Lord the righteous Iudge, which had opened the things which were hid.</hi> This yet was not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:653:83"/> all, but becauſe they knew what had befallen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the whole Hoſt of Iſrael for the like ſinne of <hi>Achan,</hi> only they feared leaſt the like now ſhould befall to them. He goeth on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſaith; <hi>And they gaue themſelues to prayer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould not vtterly be deſtroyed for the fault committed.</hi> This being ſet downe generally concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the people, it followeth particularly concerning <hi>Iudas</hi> thus; <hi>Beſides, that noble</hi> Iudas <hi>exhorted the people to keepe themſelues from ſinne, forſomuch as they ſaw before their eyes the things which came to paſſe by the ſinne of theſe that were ſlaine, and hauing made a gathering through the company, ſent to Ieruſalem about two thouſand drachmes of ſiluer, to offer a ſinne offering.</hi> Which words containing the narration of the fact of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who would otherwiſe vnderſtand but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that that is gone before, that <hi>Iudas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

How then ſhall we interpret that which he did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then of that which by order was to bee done, when as we ſee nothing elſe done that ſhould be anſwerable to that order? To offer a ſinne offering for the multitude, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the law, and therefore we may well preſume that he did ſo, and cannot but take that which he did to be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo, rather then of that whereof the law commanded nothing, nor example is there found of any that did the like. But the hiſtorian not content to ſet downe the narration of this matter ſimply, as it ſeemeth hee found it in the former ſtorie which he followed, taketh vpon him to giue his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and maketh thereof conſtruction according to his

                        <hi>a dead man buried in the graue of</hi> Elizeus <hi>vpon the touching of his bones reuiued and liued againe.</hi> Be it ſo, but doth he reade that hereupon there was euer any pilgrimage vſed to the bones of <hi>Elizeus?</hi> or doth he finde that they who carryed the body to be buried, did purpoſely goe on pilgrimage to the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> as thinking to receiue any benefit thereby? Surely, they did caſually what they did; they ſaw enimies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching, and for haſt they caſt the dead man into <hi>Elizeus</hi> graue.

Which if it be of ſo great vſe and neceſſity as they pretend now, we muſt thinke it was likewiſe behouefull and neceſſary then; or if they could then be well without it, there is no cauſe to thinke it ſo religious and neceſſary now.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:653:88"/> to the figure; whence it followeth, that the Proteſtants new deuices, hold no due correſpondence with them. I haue already confuted this his aſſertion,</hi> That Chriſt at his comming, confirmed the faith and religion of the Iewes, without any additions of his owne, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it ſimply and nakedly (only ſtripping it of types and ſhadowes) to be preached to all nations: <hi>And here I adde, that then Christians may yet haue many wiues together, as the Iewes had, or giue their wiues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any diſpleaſure, a libell of diuorſe; for theſe were no ſhadowes nor ceremonies. And briefly, it ſhould follow thereof, that all that part of their law that doth belong to iuſtice and iudgement, ſtands ſtill in full force and vertue among vs Chriſtians: which is moſt oppoſite to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Apoſtles in the firſt Councel holden at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, where it was plainly decided, that</hi> we Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<note place="margin">Act. 15. verſ. 28.</note> were not bound to keepe the old law. <hi>Againe, if the Apoſtles were</hi> ſimply and nakedly, to preach vnto the Gentiles the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> ſtript of types and ſhadowes, <hi>why were they commanded to preach vnto them the</hi> Sacrament of baptiſme, <hi>or of our</hi> Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>which are no where commanded in the law of</hi> Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? <hi>Well, let this then paſſe, as a moſt notorious and groſse ouerſight.</hi> But the Apoſtles (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) added nothing of their owne, <hi>which is very falſe; for many things were left by our Sauiour to their diſpoſition: whereupon Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> Caetera cum venero diſponam, I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe<note place="margin">

If he can ſhew vs any promiſe made to <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> concerning forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and eternall life, to be obtained by his bloud, hee ſhall ſay ſomewhat to the purpoſe; but ſith hee cannot doe ſo, little reaſon had he and leſſe conſcience to alleage the example of that prayer of <hi>Salomon,</hi> for defence of ſuch a prayer, or rather ſuch a blaſphemy, as theirs is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he himſelfe is ſo aſhamed as that euen here where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth it, he ſeemeth loth to vtter it, repeating in Latin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wordes, <hi>Tu per Thomae ſanguinem,</hi> and whereas the prayer is by the bloud of <hi>Thomas</hi> to be brought to heauen, ſetting downe in ſteede thereof, <hi>take compaſsion vpon vs.</hi> Now although he haue thus ſhewed himſelfe a monſtrous man, in defending this horrible impiety of mingling the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted bloud of a vile traitour, with the ſacred and innocent bloud of the vnſpotted Lambe of God, yet to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very goodly for himſelfe, he paſſeth from it with a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall extenuation, thus; <hi>I will not dwell vpon theſe imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:653:93"/> and looſe follies, which all that be not babes may of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues eaſily deſcry.</hi> Indeede he may well call them on his owne part <hi>impertinent and looſe follies,</hi> which are no otherwiſe tyed togither but with ſuch ſlender knots; which are ſo pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably impious, as that there is no babe ſo ſimple that hath any common vnderſtanding of Chriſtian faith, but ſeeth the groſſeneſſe and abſurdity thereof. But herein he followeth the ſteps of his companions, whoſe manner it is where they are moſt wounded to make ſhew to laugh moſt, and namely of <hi>M. Harding,</hi> who being preſſed with this ſacrilegious prayer, anſwered that it <hi>was an obiection meete for a Cobler,</hi> ſo very a trifle is it with them to abaſe the merit of the Sonne of God, by matching with it the demerit of a wicked and wilfull man. Vpon this tranſition he <hi>inferreth out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes</hi> two cruell concluſions. <hi>Firſt, that no religion was to be called Catholike before the Gospell was preached vnto all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> True, but yet the ſame faith and religion was before though it were not as yet called Catholike til it were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto all nations. <note n="f" place="margin">Aug. cont.

                        <hi>There was no difference of the doctrine,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Auſtin, <hi>though there were difference of the time.

Our conformity with them muſt not be in ſhadowes and figures, which were no longer to continue but <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>vntill the time of reformation ſhould come;</hi> but in the ſubſtance and truth which thoſe pictures and ſhadowes for the time helped them to vnderſtand that they might beleeue, and which Chriſt hath taught vs now to beleeue without any of their helps. To cleaue to the ſhadow ſtill when the body is in place, what is it but to play with a ſhadow, and to neglect the body? <hi>The figure</hi> whereof <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> ſpeaketh is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:653:93"/> outward and corporall; <hi>the verity and truth</hi> is inward and ſpirituall. The reſembling then of thoſe outward figures in Popiſh outward ceremonies, is not a conformity betwixt <hi>the verity and the figure,</hi> but rather that that is betwixt figure and figure, betwixt one picture and another. As for vs, we hold that <hi>due correſpondence with</hi> that old church which God requireth, who wholly without thoſe figures hold that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall truth which they beleeued therein. He goeth on and ſaith, that <hi>he hath already confuted my aſſertion, that Chriſt at his comming confirmed the faith and religion of the Iewes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any additions of his owne, and commended it ſimply and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, only ſtripping it of types and ſhadowes, to be preached to the nations.</hi> Where note, I pray thee, gentle Reader, that whereas I ſay that Chriſt confirmed <hi>the ſame faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and no other,</hi> he ſetteth downe of his owne deuice, <hi>the ſame faith and religion without any additions of his owne;</hi> which although it be true as touching ſubſtance of faith and religion, for therein Chriſt added nothing, yet it ſheweth his lewd minde for that he hath done it to euill purpoſe, that he might giue way to himſelfe with ſome colour to cauill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, as preſently after he doth, that Chriſt added o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignes and Sacraments, which the Iewiſh Church before receiued not. But let him report my wordes as he findeth them, and then they ſhall ſtand good, that Chriſt taught no other but the ſame faith and religion that was deliuered by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets to the former Church, which is not hindered by that he inſtituted new Sacraments, becauſe I haue already ſhewed that in diuerſity of Sacraments there is ſtill the ſame faith. Which how handſomely he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed hath before appeared, and I ſuppoſe by that time he hath further conſidered of the matter, he will finde cauſe to ſeeke for a better confutation. But yet taking it vpon him that he hath confuted me, he goeth on, ſaying: <hi>And here I adde that then Chriſtians may haue many wiues togither as the Iewes had, and may giue their wiues vpon any displeaſure a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But haply ſomewhat it was that he aimed at, which his troubled head ſerued him not to expreſſe.

And of that diſpenſation the ſame <hi>Gregory</hi> taketh an example of the Iewes, giuing a bill of diuorce, concerning which we ſee how the Phariſees alleage in the Goſpell not that God ordained it, but only that <hi>Moſes ſo commanded</hi> or rather <hi>ſuffered,</hi> and the reaſon thereof giuen, <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 19 78.</note>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:653:94"/> As for <hi>the iudiciall law</hi> of the Iewes, it is wholly without the occaſion and compaſſe of my ſpeech, and briefly I anſwere him, that though there be the ſame faith and the ſame rules of duty and conuerſation, yet it doth not therefore follow that cenſures and puniſhments, or trials and legall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings muſt be the ſame. In a word, whatſoeuer the Apoſtles decreed in their Councell at Hieruſalem for the abrogating of the law, we acknowledge and obey, and that more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully then the Papiſts doe, who, as <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> confeſſeth, doe hold it their grace ſtill to hold a conformity with the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the law. Yet againe, <hi>if the Apoſtles,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were ſimply and nakedly to preach to the Gentiles the law of</hi> Moſes (he ſhould ſay without ambiguity, the faith and religion of the Patriarchs and Prophets) <hi>ſtript of types and ſhadowes, why then were they commanded to preach vnto them the ſacraments of Baptiſme and of the Supper of the Lord?</hi> An idle queſtion, and it is already anſwered, that in deliuering other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they taught no other but the ſame doctrine and faith. The Sacraments are water in Baptiſme, bread and wine in the Lords Supper, different from thoſe of old. The doctrine of faith is the death of Chriſt, and ſhedding of his bloud for the cleanſing of our ſoules and remiſſion of our ſinnes, which was the ſame in all the Sacrifices and Sacraments of the Church ſince the world beganne. And this <hi>one doctrine</hi> I ſaid the Apoſtles by the commandement of Chriſt ſo taught, <hi>as that they added nothing of their owne. This,</hi> ſaith M. Biſhop, <hi>is very falſe; for many things were left by our Sauiour to their dispoſition.</hi> Now thou muſt vnderſtand, gentle Reader, that I vſed not thoſe wordes as mine owne, but did ſet them downe in a diſtinct letter, quoting <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the margent as the authour of them.

Biſhop</hi> therefore ſhould haue vſed his diſcretion to put a difference betwixt matter of order and matter of faith, ſo to vnderſtand that though the Apoſtles might, as the Church alwaies may, preſcribe orders for decency and conueniency in the publike aſſemblies and gouernement of the Church, yet that in doctrine and faith, neither they then, nor the Church now, may adde any thing to that which Chriſt our Lord commanded and deliuered both to them and vs. Of the ſame kinde is his other proofe out of that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle faith for aduice to the vnmarried ſo ſtill to abide, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

Aduiſe is of things arbitrary to be done; faith is of things neceſſary to be beleeued. The Apoſtle therfore might giue wholſome aduiſe without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the Lord, and yet cannot hereupon be ſaid to teach a new article of faith. I ſaid further in my anſwere, that the Apoſtles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched only <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 1. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>the Gospell, promiſed before by the Prophets in the holy Scriptures. M. Biſhop</hi> telleth me <hi>that I belye the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and corrupt the text by adding the word, only.</hi> But I ſet downe the word <hi>only</hi> in a letter diſtinct from the wordes of the text, as appeareth in my booke, though he would not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, but hudleth all together, and therefore there was no cauſe for him to charge me with corrupting the text. And what? will he ſay notwithſtanding that it was not meant that they preached only <hi>the Goſpell promiſed in the Scriptures?</hi> Surely the Apoſtle noteth his calling and ſeruice to haue bin <hi>to preach the Gospell of God.</hi> This <hi>Gospell of God,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>God had promiſed before by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures.</hi> Now if <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> will ſay that though the Goſpell were there promiſed, yet the whole Goſpell was not promiſed; he wrongeth the Apoſtle by making his wordes partly true and partly falſe; true in one part of the Goſpell, becauſe one part was promiſed; falſe in another part, becauſe that other part was not promiſed. Which to auoide, he muſt confeſſe that the whole Goſpell was <hi>promiſed in the Scriptures of the Prophets,</hi> and becauſe the Apoſtles preached only the Goſpel of God, therefore they preached only the Goſpell promiſed in the Scriptures. And thus in the end of the ſame Epiſtle the Apoſtle ſpeaketh againe to the ſame effect, that <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 16. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>the myſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Gospell was publiſhed amongst all nations by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Prophets.</hi> We doe not thinke he dallied in ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to meane, <hi>the Gospell is publiſhed,</hi> that is to ſay, a part
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:653:96"/> thereof but not the whole, but the Goſpell entirely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly is preached by the Scriptures of the Prophets. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore elſewhere he profeſſeth that in preaching the Goſpell <hi rend="sup">f</hi>

                        <hi>ſay ſhould come.</hi> But here <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> ſaith, <hi>I mangle the text and breake off in the midſt of a ſentence, that it might ſeeme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to all points of the Apoſtles preachings which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle applieth only to Chriſts death and reſurrection, and the preaching and carrying of light to the Gentiles.</hi> But he himſelfe rather doth wrong in ſo abridging the wordes of the Apoſtle contrary to the practiſe of the Apoſtle, who though here he name only a briefe of ſome principall points as accuſloma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is done, yet vnder theſe as the chiefe comprehendeth the whole doctrine which he taught. He vſed the wordes to take away the offence which was generally conceiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his preaching, and ſeeing he did not preach theſe only particulars which are here ſet downe, neither were they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended only at theſe, therefore he muſt be ſo vnderſtood as that the wordes muſt be applyed to all the reſt, and that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as put in ſteede of all, whereat they were offended moſt of all. And if we doe not ſo take them, we make him ſubiect to calumniation, becauſe he could not affirme that <hi>he ſaid no other things then the Prophets and</hi> Moſes <hi>did ſay ſhould come,</hi> if in any other points he taught any thing that had not the teſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. Yea when the ſame Apoſtle ſaith generally of <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 3. 21. 22</note> 
                        <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, that it hath the witneſſe of the law and the Prophets,</hi> how can <hi>M.

The vnbeliefe or ignorance of the reſt, I trow, hindereth not but that theſe things were then contained in the faith of the Church, and in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of that time, vnleſſe <hi>M.

Seeing then the Goſpell is written as <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſaith, it followeth by <hi>Tertullian</hi> that beſide the written word there is nothing elſe to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued. <hi>Nothing leſſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>M. Biſhop.</hi> And why? <hi>For in that whole Treatiſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>his principall drift is to proue that Heretikes cannot be confuted out of the written word, but by ancient cuſtomes and traditions which he calleth Preſcriptions.</hi> Where he moſt ſhamefully abuſeth that worke of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> expounding <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> to be meant of <hi>old cuſtomes and traditions,</hi> whereas <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath nothing to that purpoſe, but by <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> meaneth grounds of reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:653:100"/> whereby to proceede and deale againſt Heretikes for the reprouing and conuincing of them. Neither doth he goe about to proue that Heretikes cannot be confuted by the written word, but only ſheweth that it was to no purpoſe to deale with them by the Scriptures or written word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they receiued and reiected Scriptures as they liſt, did put in and blot out, alter and chop and change, ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer made againſt them ſhould goe for no Scripture. Yea the matters of their hereſies were touching thoſe articles of our faith, which are clearely and manifeſtly teſtified by the Scriptures, and therefore <hi>M.

He told vs before to <hi>Ireneus</hi> that <hi>the Apoſtles left the Goſpell in writing.</hi> Here to <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaking of the Goſpell, he anſwereth, that <hi>the Goſpell</hi> ſignifieth <hi>the whole doctrine of Chriſt both written and vnwritten.</hi> So when he liſt the Goſpell is written, and when he liſt the Goſpell is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, and he cannot tell certainly what it is. If the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell were left in writing, then the Goſpell is no doctrine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written; or if the Goſpell doe ſignifie alſo vnwritten do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, then the Apoſtles did not leaue the Goſpell in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but only a part and parcell thereof.

                        <hi>You are Biſhops within the Church, but without the Church God hath appointed me to be a Biſhop,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying thereby that the acting and adminiſtring of diuine offices &amp; Sacraments did belong to them, but that otherwiſe the gouernement of the Church and the power of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all, for the preſeruation of religion, and well ordering of Church affaires, did belong to him. Though temporall Magiſtrates then be no Eccleſiaſticall perſons in the former ſenſe, yet a King as a Chriſtian is a member of the Church, and as a King by <hi>Conſtantines</hi> iudgement is appointed of God to bee externally the Ruler and Gouernour thereof. Wherefore to call the ſtate of Kings, as <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> doth, <hi>a ſecular ſtate,</hi> as hauing to meddle only with ſecular, and temporall things, is a ſecular and prophane interpretation of the office of Kings, and a meere begging of the point in queſtion. And of that preſumption he inferreth another, when he ſaith, <hi>Is it meete and decent that the leſſe worthy member ſhould haue the ſupreme command ouer the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable?</hi> I will not here ſtand vpon his abſurd croſſing of himſelfe, who hauing euen now made the ſtate Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Secular two diſtinct bodies, doth make them here <hi>members</hi> both of one body. To let that paſſe, who will grant him that the King is <hi>the leſſe worthy,</hi> and the Prieſt <hi>the more honourable?</hi> He will ſay, that matters of the ſoule which are of higheſt nature, are adminiſtred by Prieſts. Be it ſo, and matters of the ſoule which are of the higheſt nature, are commanded by Kings, and the commanding power as we ſuppoſe is alwaies more honourable then the adminiſtring office. The very Heathens thought that the deuotions to their Gods which were acted by their Prieſts, were of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reſpect, and yet they were not ſo fond as to conclude
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:653:111"/> hereof, that the perſon of the Prieſt was more honourable then the King. In the policy ordered by God himſelfe, we finde <note n="l" place="margin">2. Kings 23. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>the Prieſts commanded by the King,</hi> but we doe not finde the King commanded by the Prieſt. We finde the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſtiling himſelfe <note n="m" place="margin">1. Kings 1. 24. 26. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>the Kings ſeruant,</hi> and the King <hi>his Lord,</hi> but we doe not finde the King giuing that honour to the Prophet. We know that in the naturall body, the heart miniſtreth life vnto the head, and yet the ſupremacy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour reſteth in the head, euen for the gouernement and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of things belonging to that life, which is adminiſtred by the heart. Euen ſo, albeit the miniſtring of thoſe things which concerne the ſaluation and life, both of Prince and people belong to the Prieſt, yet that hindereth not, but that the higheſt honour and dignity reſteth in the Prince, ſo farre as to command for the due vſage and execution of thoſe things, which concerne the ſaluation both of himſelfe and of his people. <hi>This is,</hi> ſaith M. Biſhop, <hi>to preferre the body before the ſoule, nature before grace, earth before heauen.</hi> Full wiſely ſpoken; as if a Chriſtian King were nothing but <hi>body, and nature, and earth;</hi> but a Prieſt no other but <hi>ſpirit, and grace, and heauen.</hi> Yet we doubt not, but that many Kings are more ſpirituall and gracefull, and heauenly, then many Prieſts; and many Prieſts, euen Popes themſelues, more ſauouring of the body and nature and earth, then many Kings; and how doe we then by giuing the ſoueraignty to Kings, preferre <hi>the body before the ſoule, nature before grace, earth before heauen?</hi> Forſooth, the matters of the ſoule, and of grace, and of heauen, he will ſay, are managed by Prieſts. Be it ſo; make compariſon then of the things, but make no compariſon thereby of the perſons. Say, he that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the things that belong to the Kings affaires, before thoſe things that are miniſtred by the Prieſt, preferreth the body before the ſoule, &amp;c. but we ſay, we may in outward ſtate of gouernement giue the ſupreme honour and dignity to the King, and yet preferre the things that are managed by the Prieſt, before thoſe things that are managed by the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:653:111"/> King. Albeit I alwaies adde that to the King as without the Church, belongeth the care and ouerſight of thoſe things that pertaine to the ſauing of ſoules, and to the furthering of his ſubiects in the grace of God, and in the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſo as that in this reſpect there is no cauſe why the Prieſt ſhould be accounted ſuperiour to the King. And this our Princes haue done and ſtill doe, and yet <hi>the world</hi> with vs, thanks be to God, <hi>is not turned topſie-turuy,</hi> but our ſtate ſtandeth vpright, and proſpereth maugre the hearts of all Romiſh malignant traitours and enemies, that haue ſought the ruine and ouerthrow thereof.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:653:112"/> who before fell from the faith of their fore-fathers, are vndoubtedly ſlipt into errour and infidelity. By which diſcourſe it is euident, that I tendered a most reaſonable requeſt vnto his Maieſty, that he would imbrace and countenance that religion, which all his Progenitors euen to the firſt Chriſtian among them, had liued and dyed in; becauſe they were all Catholike, and not one of them can be named, who changed the religion of his fore-fathers: yet this notwithſtanding,</hi> Simmachus <hi>the Pagan vſing the like argument in ſhew, was not to be heard; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, becauſe his fore-fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for whoſe Idolatry he pleaded, had before forſaken the true and ſincere worſhip of the one liuing God, and therefore their children were not to continue in their Idolatry, but to returne vnto their former Anceſtors true piety. So were the Donatists children (of whom</hi> S. Auguſtine <hi>cited by</hi> M.

And ſo ſhall they returne</hi> vnto the roote and originall of our Lords tradition, <hi>as</hi> S.

This caſe we put concerning the conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our nation, whereat he aimeth, by <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monke, who though he brought hither the Chriſtian religion, yet brought it ſomewhat blended and ſowred with the leauen of humane traditions and inuentions, ſo that to receiue reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as he brought it, is to receiue the corruption which he alſo brought; which being growen ſince, as in corruptions it falleth out, from a little ſcabbe to a foule leproſie, yet ſhall the foule leproſie be coloured and defended by the example of the ſcabbe. This caſe being put, <hi>M.

Here then we are new to ſeeke, and are forced to make further enquiry whether the faith of Chriſt, as it was taught here firſt by that Romiſh Monke, were in any ſuch ſort defiled or not. But that being granted, that a country is at the firſt rightly and truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the faith of Chriſt, how ſhall the poſterity after ſo many generations haue infallible aſſurance, that <hi>they hold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolably the ſame doctrine which they embraced, who were first conuerted?</hi> What rolles, what records haue we certainly and particularly to informe vs that our fathers, and fathers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and their fathers and forefathers, from the beginning, haue without adding or detracting, without change or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration either of phraſe or meaning, beleeued and practiſed thus and thus?

We finde many times differences and diſagreements amongſt them, and that reproued by one which is approued by another. Sometimes we deſcry lyes and tales, wilfully deuiſed, and falſly fathered vpon the times and perſons that haue beene before, and guilefully thruſt into ancient bookes for the gracing of ſuperſtitions that haue growen of latter times, and other writings and ſtories ſuppreſſed and made away, which taxed ſuch ſuperſtitions as they did ariſe. Many vncertainties there are, many difficulties and perplexities in this courſe, and vnpoſſible it is for them that are the authors of it, to ſet downe out of any records any perfect forme of their owne faith, whereof a man can but reaſonably ſatisfie himſelfe that it hath beene vniuerſally and vniformely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all our fathers, and continued wholly the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration from the firſt conuerted till our time. <hi>M.

Now then, <hi>M. Biſhop,</hi> be content that we returne the ſame to you. You ſay that all our Anceſtours from the beginning continued in one and the ſame, euen your religion. Shall we now for triall hereof goe to our Anceſtours, and aske them whether it be ſo or not? No, but we will goe to holy Scripture, and there ſee what was the faith and religion of them who are our true Anceſtours, the firſt fathers and founders of the Chriſtian Church; the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts; and there we finde
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:653:116"/> a farre other manner of faith then Popery doth yeeld, whereby we certainly vnderſtand that they haue corrupted the true faith. His exception againſt the Donatiſts pleading of their fathers, is the ſame as againſt <hi>Symmachus,</hi> that <hi>their fathers were degenerated from the integrity of their grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and therefore were not to be followed.</hi> But yet the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts held that all their forefathers were of their minde, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as ſtifly as the Papiſts doe. They ſaid that they were not fallen from the Catholike Church, but the Catholike church from them, ſo as that they affirmed it to haue beene their Church, which was perſecuted by <hi>Nero</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Roman Tyrants, as I haue before ſhewed in the ſecond Chapter.

But I may not ſlippe</hi> M.

But how can it be, ſaith one, that they who hate the wicked harlot, ſhould ioyne with the beast who was as wicked as

But the ſpirit of God hath preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and wholly cut off this vaine imagination; for it ſaith in the next verſe,</hi> That the ten Kings who hated the harlot, <hi>euen then and after too,</hi> gaue their Kingdomes to the beaſt, till the word of God be conſummate, <hi>that is, till the end of all. Wherefore most manifeſt it is, euen by the warrant of Gods ſacred word, that thoſe Kings mentioned in the Apocalypſe, were reprobates: ſuch did they liue, and ſuch ſhall they die. Let then his most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maiesty cenſure, what reward they are worthy off, who feare not to thrust his Highneſſe into that list of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned cast-a-waies; and that too, after they had ſuch

                        <hi>in the yeare</hi> 792. Charles <hi>the King of France ſent ouer into Britaine a ſynodall booke, or booke of a Councell, directed to him from Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, in which booke (alas for woe) many things were found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient and contrary to true faith, ſpecially for that by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of all the Eaſterne Doctors, no leſſe then three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Biſhops and more, it was decreed that Images ſhould be worſhipped, which thing the Church of God wholly accurſeth. Againſt which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Albinus wrote an Epiſtle wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthened by authority of holy Scriptures, and brought it together with the booke to the King of France, in the name or behalfe of our Biſhops and Peeres.</hi> The Roman faith which <hi>Austin</hi> brought condemned that Nicene Councell. Tho Roman faith which <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> bringeth approueth that Councell, for ſo hath he done in his <note n="c" place="margin">Sect. 12.</note> Epiſtle to the King. Therefore the Roman faith which <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> bringeth is not now the ſame that <hi>Auſtin</hi> brought. He cannot doubt but that <hi>Auſtin</hi> being ſent hither by <hi>Gregory,</hi> did teach the ſame faith here which <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelfe taught at Rome. But the faith which <hi>Gregory</hi> taught at Rome ſhall be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if God will, in this booke in many particulars, to haue beene contrary to that faith that is now taught from Rome. As for our writers <hi>Bale, Iewell, Hollinſhead,</hi> and ſuch like, I cite <hi>them not as ſufficient witneſſes in matters of controuerſie,</hi> as he vainly cauilleth, but I name them only as recording mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of hiſtory, which they haue taken out of former ſtories and writers, when mine owne Library doth not furniſh me with ſome bookes which they haue followed, in which caſe I may as well vſe their names, as Papiſts may vſe the names<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Baronius, Surius, Genebrard,</hi> and other their owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,

And</hi> M. Abbot <hi>most ignorantly or impudently, affirmeth it to haue beene 1200. yeares after the incarnation of Christ,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:653:123"/> ere the Popes authority could get any acknowledgment there: for in the very ſame hundreth yeare by him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they were ſo farre off from denying the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer them in cauſes Eccleſiasticall, that they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be alſo their Protectour in temporall affaires. For when King</hi> Edward <hi>the third, would haue giuen them</hi> Iohn Balial <hi>for their King, they anſwered him;</hi> That they would not accept of him for ſuch,<note place="margin">Walſingham in vita Edw. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1292.</note> without the Popes conſent, who had their country in protection, <hi>as they then pleaded. And</hi> M. Abbots <hi>argument to the contrary, is most friuoulous:</hi> Alexander <hi>the King</hi> bade the Popes Legate to enter his country at his perill: ergo, <hi>he did not acknowledge the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. By the like argument one might proue, that King</hi> Philip <hi>and Queene</hi> Mary <hi>did not acknowledge the Popes authority; for they commanded a Legate of his, to ſtay at Calis, and to forbeare entrance into this Realme at his perill. The Popes Legates then, when they be ſent about affaires that doe ſeeme to the Prince and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, preiudicious to the temporall ſlate, may be refuſed, without diſparagement to the Popes ſupreme authority in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall. And the King of Scots had reaſon to refuſe that Cardinall Legate, whoſe ſpeciall arrand was to collect money to maintaine the warres of the holy Land, which was not to be ſpared in his Countrey. Beſides, the very entertainement of ſuch a great State ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied, was reputed as needleſſe, ſo ouer coſtly for that poore Countrey. If</hi> M. Abbot <hi>haue no better ſtuffe then this to vphold his badde cauſe, he that best knew his owne meaning and deſignement, hath to the life painted out himſelfe, where he ſaith:</hi> They care not indeede what

How many other of your books are there in the ſame ſort common to the view of all men, and by vs made common; our care only being, not to ſuffer poiſon to goe freely abroad without a preſeruatiue, &amp; therfore hauing ioyned anſwer to them, we leaue euery one that liſt to reade at his liberty to iudge of both. It would goe amiſſe with you, <hi>M. Biſhop,</hi> if our books had that free paſſage amongſt you, that yours haue amongſt vs. Your Kingdome would ſoone goe downe, euen in Italie and Spaine, if your men had liberty to reade our anſweres, togither with your books. The laſt part of this paſſage concerneth his deliuery of a ſpeech, vttered by his Maieſty at the conference at Hampton Court; <hi>That no Church ought further to ſeparate it ſelfe from the Church of Rome in doctrine and ceremonie, then ſhee hath departed from her ſelfe, when ſhee was in her flouriſhing and best eſtate, and from Christ her Lord and head.</hi> In the rehearſall whereof I note him, that <hi>ſubtilly he left out</hi> the laſt wordes, <hi>And from Christ her Lord and head.</hi> He telleth me that <hi>I ſhew no cauſe why</hi> I doe ſo, and that <hi>indeede none can be
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:653:128"/> ſhewed, becauſe they are needleſſe wordes, and comprehended in the former.</hi> But we ſuppoſe that he needeth more vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that conceiueth thoſe wordes to be needleſſe, which are no otherwiſe comprehended in the former, then as the former are expounded by them. For although in right meaning it be true which he ſaith, that <hi>if the Church of Rome be not departed from her ſelfe when ſhee was in her flouriſhing and best eſtate, ſhee cannot bee departed from Christ her Lord and head,</hi> yet ſuch a meaning he may make of her <hi>flouriſhing and best eſtate,</hi> as that in that eſtate ſhee may be found ſomewhat to haue departed from Chriſt her Lord and head. His Maieſtie therefore to preuent this, with great iudgement added, <hi>And from Christ her Lord and head,</hi> as to note, that by her departing from Chriſt her Lord, wee are to take knowledge of her departing from her ſelfe, when ſhee was in her flouriſhing and beſt eſtate, becauſe then was her <hi>flouriſhing and best eſtate,</hi> when ſhee was neareſt to Chriſt her Lord and head, and moſt entire in the faith and doctrine, which ſhee had receiued from him. Of this <hi>flouriſhing and best eſtate,</hi> we muſt conſider in the next Chapter, and therefore I ceaſe here to ſpeake any further thereof.</p>

Any reaſonable man would rather iudge, that the Church of Rome then came firſt to her moſt flouriſhing eſtate, when Idolatry and all kinde of ſuperſtition was put to ſilence, and baniſhed out of her; when the Chriſtian religion was publikely preached and conntenanced by the Emperours authority, which was not before the reigne of</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>the Great, our most glorious countrey-man: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> M.

                        <hi>Paganiſme was decaying, and the name of Christians ariſing, and growing higher and higher from day to day.</hi> But if it were yet growing, then it was not at full growth, and therefore when will <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> ſay was <hi>the moſt flouriſhing and beſt time of the Church</hi> there? Againe, we deſire to know of him when the time was that the Church of Rome ſtoode in no neede of <hi>the Apoſtles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſtructions?</hi> May we thinke, <hi>M. Biſhop,</hi> that euer there was any ſuch time? Surely we know now what the cauſe is, why the Apoſtles diuine inſtructions are ſo little ſet by at Rome. They ſerued the Romans forſooth at firſt, when they were but <hi>nouices in the faith,</hi> but now they are growen ripe, and haue no neede to be taught by him. May we not thinke him a wiſe man, that thus telleth vs that the Romans then ſtoode in neede of the Apoſtles diuine inſtructions, as if there were any time ſince that they had not the like neede? But I would aske him how it appeareth to him, that the Romans were then <hi>but nouices in the faith?</hi> The reaſon which his wordes imply is, becauſe the Apoſtle wrote that Epiſtle to them. But ſo did he write two Epiſtles to the Corinthians, of whom notwithſtanding he ſaith, that <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>in all things they were made rich in Christ, in all kinde of ſpeech, and in all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> So did he to the Epheſians, <note n="f" place="margin">Acts 20. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>from whom he kept no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing backe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but had ſhewed them all the counſell of God.</hi> Yea and of the Romans, the Apoſtle in that Epiſtle ſaith, <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 15. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>I am perſwaded of you that yee are filled with all knowledge, and are able to admoniſh one another; Neuertheleſſe I haue ſomewhat boldly after a ſort written vnto you, as one that putteth you in remembrance.</hi> It ſhould ſeeme then that they were not <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:653:130"/> in the faith,</hi> but fully inſtructed in all points, and that the end of the Apoſtles Epiſtle was only to keepe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe things, which they had beene before taught. Of that time <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, that <note n="h" place="margin">Tertul. de Praeſcript. <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix Eccleſia cui totam doctrinam Apoſtoli cum ſuo ſanguine proſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt.</hi>

Of that time we haue a more ſure and vndoubted te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, then we can haue of times following, that <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 1. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>their faith was renowmed throughout the whole world.</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe we hold to be <hi>the best ſtate</hi> of the Roman Church, and <hi>the most flouriſhing,</hi> becauſe we meaſure not <hi>the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it by number of profeſſours, or by glory of outward ſtate, but by integrity of doctrine and truth of faith. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, becauſe <hi>flouriſhing</hi> may ſeeme to import a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that outward liberty and exaltation, which that Church as the reſt receiued, by the reigne of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and enioyed vnder other Chriſtian Emperours after him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maieſty with great caution and aduiſedneſſe added the other wordes ſpoken of before, to ſignifie that we are ſo to reſpect her in that flouriſhing eſtate, as that alwaies for more aſſurance we haue reſpect to that that ſhee was at the firſt, immediately from the Apoſtles, and from Chriſt her Lord and head, the liuely picture and deſcription whereof is ſet forth vnto vs in the Epiſtle to the Romans. Here <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> though he haue not yet proued any firſt fault, yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon him to note a ſecond, <hi>that I take an Epiſtle written to the Romans for their inſtruction and correction, as if it were a declaration and profeſsion of their faith.</hi> Where the Reader ſeeth, that ſaue only I ſay the Apoſtle in that Epiſtle <hi>wrote at large,</hi> I ſay nothing thereof my ſelfe, but report only what <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith, who if he had affirmed that the Apoſtle in that Epiſtle did ſet downe <hi>a declaration of the faith,</hi> which the Romans then profeſſed, had ſaid nothing amiſſe; the care of the Apoſtle therein being both to confirme them in the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:653:131"/> faith which they had receiued, and to teſtifie to poſterity what that faith was. <hi>All men know,</hi> ſaith M.

                        <hi>We who are Iewes by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a man is not iuſtified by the workes of the law, but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, euen we haue beleeued in Christ that we might (or may) be iuſtified by the faith of Christ, and not by the workes of the law, becauſe by the workes of the law no fleſh ſhall be iuſtified.</hi> Where wee ſee the proceſſe of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, plainly deſcribed as we haue ſaid, <hi>from faith to faith,</hi> the Apoſtle profeſſing to haue beleeued in Chriſt, not thenceforth to be iuſtified by workes as Popery teacheth, but to be iuſtified by faith, becauſe being now beleeuers they knew that by the workes of the law no fleſh ſhould be iuſtified. And this meaning is further confirmed by the proofe which the Apoſtle bringeth of the wordes, whereof we ſpeake; <note n="ſ" place="margin">Habac. 2 4.</note> 
                        <hi>as it is written,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>The iust ſhall liue by faith.</hi> For although thoſe wordes of the Prophet doe ſeeme to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute iuſtification and life to faith, yet no otherwiſe doe they inferre it to be <hi>from faith to faith,</hi> but in that ſort as I haue ſaid. Certaine it is that but by faith no man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to be called a iuſt man, and therefore in the very name of <hi>the iuſt,</hi> is an implication of faith. The Prophet then teacheth, that a man being by faith become a iuſt man, is not thenceforth to expect life by his iuſtice, but to goe on from faith to faith; <hi>the iust,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall liue,</hi> not by his iuſtice, but <hi>by his faith.</hi> For this cauſe doth he expreſſe it, not by the preſent, <hi>The iuſt doth liue,</hi> as the vulgar corruptly readeth, but by the future tenſe, <hi>The iuſt ſhall liue by faith,</hi> as to note that <hi>the iuſtice of God,</hi> that is, the iuſtice for which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth and iuſtifieth vs, as it beganne, ſo proceedeth euen
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:653:138"/> to the attainement of euerlaſting life, not by workes, but by faith only. And of all this we haue a notable example in our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is ſet before vs as the patterne and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of all the faithfull, of whom after that <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 12. 1. 2, &amp;c. Heb. 11. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>by faith he had obeyed God,</hi> to goe out of his owne Countrey, and had wrought many workes of iuſtice and righteouſneſſe, yet to ſhew this continuation of <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God, from faith to faith,</hi> it is ſaid; <note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 15. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Abraham beleeued the Lord, and hee counted that to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> He was not firſt iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, to be afterwards iuſtified by workes, but ſtill his faith was it for which he was reputed righteous in the ſight of God. By all this then we ſee a direct oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the doctrine of the ancient Roman Church, and the doctrine of the Papiſts. The Papiſts ſay that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God beginneth with faith, but the perfection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is in workes, and that it conſiſteth <hi>moſt properly and truly</hi> in the righteouſneſſe of works, and that the iuſt man though he become iuſt by faith, yet muſt afterwards with God be iuſtified, and attaine to life by workes. But the old Church of Rome was farre otherwiſe minded, that iuſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God beginneth in faith, and is determined in faith, and that the iuſt man, be he neuer ſo iuſt, muſt liue, not by his iuſtice, but by his faith; it being true of <hi>iuſt men,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> telleth vs, which is ſaid, <note n="x" place="margin">Hieron. adu.

But hereby wee may ſee that all the wordes which they vſe as touching grace, are but hypocriſie and deceipt, and that their true reſolution is, that the deſert of heauen iſſueth out of the free will of man, vſing grace as a toole or inſtrument for the doing of workes, whereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame. Thus of gift they make no gift, and turne all wholly into merit, and by the free will of man doe vtterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow the grace of God, carrying notwithſtanding in the meane time a conſcience of ſhame of that they teach, and colouring all with good workes, as <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Heretike and his followers in the ſame caſe were wont to doe.

Thus briefly any indifferent Reader may perceiue, how farre</hi> S. Paul <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly taken, is from affording any reliefe vnto the Proteſtant cauſe. They doe now, as many vnlearned and vnſtable men did, euen in his owne time, (witneſſe Saint Peter</hi>) depraue <hi>and miſuſe</hi> certaine ſentences of his,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. verſ. 16.</note> hard to be vnderſtood, to their owne perdition, <hi>and to the deceiuing and vndoing of their followers: for in all his Epiſtles (being vnderſtood as he meant them) there is not one word or ſillable, that maketh for the Proteſtants, or any other Sectaries; and plenty there are of plaine texts for the most points of the Catholike faith. A taſt whereof I will giue you, as ſoone as I ſhall haue made an end of anſwering vnto this his idle diſcourſe.</hi>

                        <hi>Eraſmus</hi> reporteth, that preaching on a time ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtantly and earneſtly, to ſtirre men vp to goe againſt the Turkes and Paynims, and comming at length to lament that none offered themſelues to be Captaines and leaders in this ſeruice, profeſſeth in the end that rather then there ſhould be any vvant in that behalfe, he vvould not ſticke to caſt off his Franciſcan vveede, and become himſelfe a Captaine or a Souldier amongſt them. At vvhich vvordes he caſt off his vpper garment, and vnderneath vvas attired and furniſhed as a Souldier, and ſo proſecuted this matter for the ſpace of halfe an houre, and being afterwards queſtioned vvhy hee thus did, confeſſed that he did it for his Minions ſake, vvho had told him that ſhee diſliked nothing in him, but his Friars vveede. Whereupon he demanding in vvhat attire he ſhould beſt content her, and ſhee anſwering that ſhee could beſt like of him in the habit of a Souldier, he bid her be the next day at Sermon, and ſhee ſhould ſee him ſo, and then played <hi>Robin good-fellowes</hi> part in that ſort as I haue ſaid. In the ſame place <hi>Eraſmus</hi> telleth of that <hi>Licienſis,</hi> the ſtorie to vvhich I before alluded, <note n="f" place="margin">Eraſm. ibid.</note> that being on a day to preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope and his Cardinals, when he ſaw them come in with that Princely pompe, and the Pope carryed in a chaire,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:653:167"/> and all men doing worſhip to him, without any other words beginneth to cry out, <hi>Fie vpon</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Peter, <hi>fie vpon</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul, ſpitting and turning this way and that way, and ſo gate him downe againe, leauing all aſtoniſhed at him, ſome thinking him to be fallen madde, and other ſome imagining him to be become an Heretike or a Pagan. Being afterwards exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined how he fell to ſuch horrible blaſphemie, he anſwered that he had prepared a farre other matter to ſpeake of, which he imparted to them, but when I ſaw you, ſaith he, come in with ſuch pompe and liue ſo deliciouſly, and withall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with my ſelfe, how meane, how painfull, and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a life the Apoſtles led, in whoſe places you ſucceede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I gathered with my ſelfe, that either they were fooles that went ſo hard a way to heauen, or elſe that you goe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way to hell. But of you, ſaith he, who haue the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen, I could not miſdoubt any euill. It remained therefore that I ſhould deteſt the folly of them, vvho when they might haue liued gloriouſly and pleaſantly as you doe, would rather through their whole life with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and watching, and labour torment themſelues. Now as in this caſe this <hi>Robertus Licienſis</hi> cryed, <hi>Fie vpon</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul, for their kinde of life ſo vnlike to the life of Popes and Cardinals; ſo I thought it might be likely that <hi>M.

Biſhop</hi> ſaith, that <hi>there is no ſhadow of likelyhood that one ſhould tell the Pope ſuch a tale to his face, or that</hi> Eraſmus <hi>being in moſt points a Catholike would report it.</hi> But for the inducing of his Reader to this opinion, ſee a trick of this honeſt man. For if he had truly quoted the place as he found it by me ſet downe, he thought his Reader would perhaps looke the place, and ſo would finde it to be as I had ſaid. But to preuent this, whereas I had noted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>Eraſm. de rat.

                     <hi>TO beginne with the firſt, there is plaine testimony, that we are iuſtified before God by workes, which I cited before:</hi> VVith God the doers of the law ſhall be<note place="margin">Rom. 2. verſ. 13.</note> iuſtified. <hi>There is much for free-will, witneſſe this:</hi> Let not ſinne therefore raigne in your mortall body,<note place="margin">Ibid. 6. verſ. 12. &amp; 13.</note> that you obey the concupiſcence thereof, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe you exhibite your members inſtruments of iniquity vnto ſinne; but exhibite your ſelues to God, of dead men aliue, and your members inſtruments of iuſtice to God: for ſinne ſhall not haue dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you, for you are not vnder the law, but vnder grace. <hi>See how the Apoſtle maketh it in the power and will of euery man indued with Gods grace, either to doe
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:653:168"/> well, or to doe euill: and that</hi> ſinne hath no ſuch domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer them, <hi>but that they may doe well, if they will concurre with Gods grace. Item, that it is not grace which doth all, but a man must worke with grace, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite the powers of his ſoule, as inſtruments towards the producing of good workes; which is flatly our doctrine of free-will. And before we depart from this matter of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as</hi> M. Abbot <hi>doth very quickly, you ſhall heare more of it out of the ſame Apoſtle: he teacheth expreſly, that a man in the ſtate of grace may fulfill the law, in theſe wordes.</hi> For that which was impoſſible to the law,<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 8. v. 3.</note> in that it was weakned by fleſh, God ſending his Sonne in the ſimilitude of the fleſh of ſinne, euen of ſinne, damned ſinne in the fleſh, that the iuſtification of the law might bee fulfilled in vs, who walke not according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit. <hi>Which is ſeconded in the thirteenth Chapter, where he concludeth</hi> loue to be the fulneſſe of the law, <hi>hauing</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. v. 9. &amp; 10.</note> 
                     <hi>before ſaid, that</hi> he who loueth his neighbour fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the law. <hi>And as for that certainty of ſaluation, which many Proteſtants bragge of, the Apoſtle doth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſſeſſe them of it: firſt in the place before cited, where he willeth</hi> them that ſtand right in the true<note place="margin">Rom. 11. ver. 20.</note> faith, to beware that they fall not; <hi>and aſſureth them that they</hi> ſhall fall as others had done before them, if they did not diligently looke vnto it. <hi>Elſewhere he aduiſeth vs</hi> with feare and trembling to worke our<note place="margin">Philip. 2. ver. 12.</note> ſaluation. <hi>Marke how two points of the Proteſtant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be wounded in one ſentence, and two of ours confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: both that we must</hi> worke our ſaluation <hi>(it comes not then by only faith) and that</hi> with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:653:169"/> 
                     <hi>we are not then aſſured of it before hand by the certainty of faith, which excludeth all feare and doubt of it. Now that we ought to haue a firme hope of ſaluation,</hi> S. Paul <hi>teacheth vs:</hi> VVe haue acceſſe through faith<note place="margin">Rom. 5. verſ. 2.</note> into this his grace, wherein we ſtand and glory in the hope of the Sonnes of God. <hi>Alſo,</hi> For by hope we<note place="margin">Ibid. 8. verſ. 24.</note> are ſaued. <hi>Item, we giue thanks to God, &amp;c.</hi> for the<note place="margin">Clooſſ. 1. verſ. 5.</note> hope that is laid vp for you in heauen. <hi>With whom</hi> S.

Paul, <hi>as in that question may be ſeene; the very</hi> faith, <hi>whereby</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>was and we are iuſtified, is no ſuch kinde of</hi> faith, <hi>as the Proteſtants claime to be iustified by, that is, by an apprehenſion and drawing of Christs righteouſneſſe to themſelues: but that faith whereby we beleeue all things to be true which God hath reuealed, as</hi> S.

I propounded out of <hi>Theodoret</hi> that the Epiſtle to the Romans containeth all manner doctrines of faith. Vpon this ground I noted that the doctrine of Popery is to be condemned, for that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſo many points as neceſſary articles of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is nothing to be found in the Epiſtle to the Romans. Herewith <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> found himſelfe greatly diſtreſſed. On the one ſide he durſt not openly reiect the teſtimony of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret,</hi> fearing leaſt that haply might be ſome preiudice to
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:653:177"/> him. On the other ſide he ſaw he could not finde their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Epiſtle to the Romans. Now therefore ſilently he ſtealeth away and betaketh himſelfe to the reſt of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, not vpon any hope that he hath that he can thence make good his cauſe, but for that hee findeth there ſome ſpeeches deliuered vpon occaſions, whereby hee can better giue colour to ſome doctrines of theirs, of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle neuer thought. He telleth his Reader, that I ſay <hi>there is nothing in</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul <hi>for the merit of ſingle life.</hi> But my ſaying was, that in the Epiſtle to the Romans which <hi>Theodoret</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth to containe <hi>all kinde of doctrine,</hi> there is nothing ſaid for <hi>the merit of ſingle life.</hi> Well, let him yet haue his way; let vs giue him full liberty of the reſt of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and what hath he there for the proofe of it. Forſooth, he telleth vs, that <hi>the Apoſtle ſaith, that the care of the ſingle and vnmarried is to pleaſe God, and their ſtudy to thinke vpon thoſe things that appertaine to God, and how they may be holy both in body and in ſpirit; which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>muſt needes be more acceptable in Gods ſight then to be carking for this world, and caring how to pleaſe their yoke-mate.</hi> But here he blindeth his Reader, by compounding thoſe things, which for the diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the truth are to be diuided. For he will not ſay that ſingle life in it ſelfe is a caring to pleaſe the Lord, and to bee holy in body and ſpirit; for then the Veſtall Virgins of the Romans, and the <hi>Hierophantaes</hi> of the Athenians, and all ſingle perſons of all ſorts ſhall be pleaſers of the Lord, and all holy both in body and ſpirit. If in it ſelfe it be not ſo, then for it ſelfe it is not acceptable in Gods ſight, but the thing which God accepteth is our care to pleaſe him, and to bee holy and vndefiled before him. Now if marriage equall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life in holineſſe and care of pleaſing God, what hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this caſe, but that marriage is as acceptable to God as ſingle life? But the Apoſtle noteth this to be the preferment of ſingle life, that wee are thereby for the moſt part better opportuned to attend the things of God, and to doe him ſeruice, being thereby freed from many burdens of cares and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:653:177"/> troubles, wherwith the husband and the wife are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much diſtracted. Which notwithſtanding muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood where the gift of continency is had, becauſe the fire of an incontinent minde cauſeth much more entangling of the thoughts, and withdrawing of the heart from God, then doe any troubles that belong to married eſtate. But doth it follow that becauſe ſingle life giueth greater liberty to ſerue God, therefore ſingle life it ſelfe is a matter of great merit with God, the vow thereof the merit of heauen, a worke of great perfection, a ſatisfaction for ſinnes, both for a mans owne ſinnes, and for the ſinnes of other men? This is the merit of ſingle life whereof I ſpake, and which Popery maintaineth, and will this foule taile hang to the wordes of the Apoſtle? Are you not aſhamed, <hi>M. Biſhop,</hi> thus to dally, and to tell vs one thing when you ſhould proue another? It is true that the care of pleaſing God, and being holy in body and ſpirit, is much more acceptable vnto God, then carking for this world, and caring how to pleaſe a wife; but will you hereof conclude a merit of ſingle life? Is not ſingle life many times more carefull of the things of the world then marriage? and is not the vnmarried often more buſied to pleaſe his harlot, then the husband is to pleaſe his wife? And will you then argue ſo abſurdly, and thus wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude them that are not able to vnderſtand you? From thence he commeth to Monkiſh vowes, <hi>of which,</hi> he ſaith, that <hi>if I were a good Abbot, I would ſpeake more respectiuely.</hi> But an Abbot whether to him good or badde, I yeeld them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect, but to ſay of them, that as Popery hath framed and practiſed them, they are full of ſacriledge, impiety, blaſphemie, hypocriſie, and one of thoſe monſtrous abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, wherewith Antichriſt hath defiled the Church of God. And what hath he now to ſay for them? <hi>Somewhat</hi> forſooth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul <hi>hath of the vow of chaſtity, which is one of their principall vowes.</hi> Well, let the other vowes ſinke or ſwimme, he careth not; but being a chaſt man he will giue vs a proofe for the vow of chaſtity, and that ſhall be a ſure
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:653:178"/> one. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul auoueheth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>certaine widdowes worthy of damnation, becauſe they broke the ſame firmer vow of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> But what; will he thus wilfully belye the Apoſtle? Will he ſet downe wordes of his owne, and make the Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that they are the Apoſtles wordes? The Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſome <hi>hauing damnation, becauſe they had broken the firſt faith,</hi> and vvill he dare to turne <hi>the firſt faith,</hi> into, <hi>the former vow of chaſtity?</hi> As touching this place I haue giuen him ſuch anſwere <note n="b" place="margin">Of vowes, ſect. 7.</note> before, as that it is vnpoſſible for him with any good colour to reply. I haue ſhewed that <hi>the first faith</hi> here ſpoken of, is the faith and profeſſion of Baptiſme, and that <hi>Athanaſius, Hierome,</hi> and <hi>

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that thoſe young widowes of which the Apoſtle ſpake, did by liuing in idleneſſe fall to wantonneſſe, and in their new marriages did wholly forſake the faith of Chriſt. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared further by <hi>Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe, Theophylact,</hi> that the Apoſtle ſeeing ſuch miſchiefe to grow of chooſing young vvomen to be Church-widomes, did wholly diſclaime all choiſe of ſuch, and willed that thoſe vvho were already cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, though they had promiſed to continue ſingle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, yet for eſchewing all danger of the like inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhould betake themſelues to marriage.

What doth hee meane thus to alleage this text againe, vvhen it ſo plainly appeareth by the teſtimony of ſo many Fathers, that that is falſe vvhich they vvould gather thereby? He vvould hereby proue their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh vow of ſingle life, binding men ſimply and perpetually from marriage, vvhich it appeareth is hereby condemned as a vvicked tyrannie, and a cruell vſurpation vpon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of fraile and vnſtable men.

Now for their pupils and ſcholers, who muſt yeeld to enlarge their throats, to ſwallow all their Maſters googeons, hee knew well enough that they would neuer, nay they dare not looke the Chapter, and as for others though they finde him a lyar, what cares he for that? He that looketh into that Chapter, or any other, what ſhall he finde that may giue him cauſe to thinke the vow of the Nazarites, like to the vow of religious perſons? The vow of religious perſons is a vow of perpetual pouerty, chaſtity, and obedience, and what is there in the vow of the Nazarites, that carryeth any ſemblance of theſe things? <note n="h" place="margin">Num. 6. 2. 3. &amp;c.</note> He was to forbeare wine and ſtrong drinke, and all things of the grape, to ſuffer no razour to come vpon his

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:653:188"/> and yet as high as he was in Gods fauour, and as well informed of the office of Chriſts mediation, hee held it needfull to requeſt other farre meaner then himſelfe, to pray for him. All this is good (ſaith a good Proteſtant)</hi> for to inſtruct vs to requeſt the helpe of other mens prayers, that are liuing with vs, but not of Saints who are departed this world. <hi>Yes ſay we, becauſe the Saints in heauen are more charitable and deſirous of Gods honour, and of our ſpirituall good, then any friend we haue liuing, and therefore more forward to aſsiſt vs with their prayers: They are alſo more gracious in the ſight of God, and thereby better able to obtayne our requests.

                     <p>HEre <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> playeth the Iugler againe, and caſteth a miſt before his Readers eyes, by altering the ſtate of the queſtion betwixt vs and them. For the queſtion is not whether the doctrine of truth haue beene at any time deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by Tradition, that is, by word of mouth without wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but whether after the old and new Teſtament written, and the Canon of the Scriptures eſtabliſhed and confirmed, there bee any thing further to bee receiued for doctrine of faith and truth, appertaining to ſaluation, that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures. Tradition as he here ſpeaketh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is confounded with Scripture, becauſe it is one and the ſame doctrine, firſt preached by word of mouth, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards committed to writing in the Scripture, but Tradition, as we queſtion it, is diuided againſt Scripture, and importeth doctrine ouer and beſide that, which is now taught vs by the Scriptures. We know well that the doctrine of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vntill the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was only taught by word of mouth, but is that an argument to proue that now that wee haue the Scriptures, we muſt alſo receiue vnwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beſides the Scriptures? Nay, when it ſeemed good to the wiſedome God, to commit his word to writing, hee would not doe it in part only, but fully and perfectly; ſo that <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 34. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Moſes wrote all the wordes of the Lord,</hi> and ſaid of that which he wrote, <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 12. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>What I command thee, that only ſhalt thou doe vnto the Lord; thou ſhalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom.</hi> Therefore, although the word of God were afterwards alſo deliuered by word of mouth in the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:653:198"/> Preachings and Sermons of the Prophets, yet were they in their Sermons to preach no other doctrine, neither did they, but what had authority and warrant by <hi>Moſes</hi> law. Now their Sermons being alſo written for expoſition and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and a further ſupply added of the Scriptures of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, how much more ought we to content our ſelues with the Scriptures, without adding to them, or taking from them, receiuing and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing only thoſe things that we are taught thereby, as being aſſured of that which the Scriptures themſelues teach, that <note n="c" place="margin">2.

                        <hi>the Scriptures are able to make a man wiſe vnto ſaluation, through the faith which is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Hereby then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>M. Biſhops</hi> fallacy, in the citing of thoſe texts which he hath here alleaged. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> willed the Romans <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>to marke and auoide them, that made diſſenſions and ſcandals, contrary to the doctrine which they had learned.</hi> True it is, and what then? <hi>But the doctrine,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which they had then learned, before</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul <hi>ſent them this Epiſtle, was by word of mouth and Tradition, for little or none of the new Teſtament was then written.</hi> Marke what he ſaith, <hi>before</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul <hi>ſent them this Epiſtle;</hi> for hereby hee in a manner acknowledgeth that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> compriſed in this Epiſtle the doctrine, which they had before learned by Tradition. The Apoſtles intendment then appeareth plainly to be this, that they ſhould ſhunne thoſe which diſſented from the doctrine which they had hitherto learned by Tradition, that is, by preaching and word of mouth, the ſumme whereof he had now ſent them written in this Epiſtle, that they might henceforth learne to ſhunne them that diſſented from the ſame doctrine, deliuered to them in the Scriptures. How ill-fauouredly then doth <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> argue out of theſe wordes, that we are now to receiue other doctrines then are contained in the Scriptures? There can no argument be rightly framed out of that text, whereof it can be any harme to vs to grant the concluſion. If he will ſet it in due order, it muſt be this; The doctrine which the Romans had learned, they had learned hitherto by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:653:199"/> but the Apoſtle teacheth them to auoide ſuch as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from the doctrine which they had learned; therefore he teacheth them to auoide ſuch as diſſented from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which they had hitherto learned by Tradition. This we grant, and what will he conclude thereof? Surely, if he will inferre any thing againſt vs, hee muſt goe on and ſay; But they learned ſomewhat then by Tradition, which is not ſince deliuered in the Scriptures. Which if hee will ſay, wee require proofe of it, and the text which he here alleageth, will yeeld none. We ſay that the whole doctrine which the Apoſtles firſt deliuered by Tradition and word of mouth, they committed afterwards to writing, ech his part as God inſpired and directed for comprehending of the whole.

They muſt perforce grant that a great part of thoſe things is written, and how doe they proue that not the whole? The ſame doe I anſwere him, and haue anſwered him before, concerning the wordes which he citeth to the Theſſalonians: <note n="u" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2. 15.</note>

Hee had not ſet downe in that Epiſtle all the doctrine of the Goſpell, which is contained in other Scriptures, which all notwithſtanding hee had <hi>by word</hi> preached vnto them. Hee willeth them therefore to hold faſt, both the things which hee had written to them in his Epiſtle, and all the things which hee had preached vnto them, which are written otherwhere, this we are ſure of; but how may we bee ſure, that hee meant to commend to them the holding faſt of thoſe doctrines, which are neither written in that Epiſtle nor otherwhere? Surely, if the wordes may haue a ſufficient meaning, being vnderſtood of thoſe things which are written, though not in that Epiſtle, yet in other either Goſpels or Epiſtles, then vainely are they allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as a neceſſary proofe, for receiuing of doctrines which are not written any where. And therefore whereas <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> inferreth; <hi>You ſee that ſome Traditions went by
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:653:200"/> word of mouth, from hand to hand, aſwell as ſome others were written,</hi> he ſheweth that he himſelfe ſeeth not what he ſaith, becauſe the place proueth only that the Apoſtle wrote not all in the Epiſtle whereof hee ſpeaketh, but that all other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is not written, it proueth not, and that all is written that is neceſſary to eternall life, I haue before ſufficiently proued out of the very doctrine it ſelfe of the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.

For euen in the Popiſh Prieſt-hood there is no <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> the power of ſacrificing being indifferently common to them all, and no more belonging to Popes and Biſhops, then to the meaneſt

                        <hi>he ſaw that through laying on the Apoſtles hands, the holy Ghoſt was giuen,</hi> and is otherwiſe alſo plainly to be perceiued. Very abſurdly therefore doth <hi>M.

And thus we are come to an end of his proofes of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles. He telleth vs that <hi>he ſhould be too long if he would proſecute all,</hi> but be thou aſſured, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader, that he hath made here as good choiſe of his proofes, as his wit would ſerue him, and thou ſeeſt what they are, and maieſt by theſe eſteeme what all the reſt
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:653:211"/> would be, impertinent, idle, detorted, wreſted, ſtrained, carrying no ſhew, no colour, when they are looked into of any ſuch matter as he pretendeth. Albeit thou art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to remember that all this while he hath ſitten beſide the cuſhion, the thing propounded being that of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> that the Epiſtle to the Romans containeth in it <hi>all kind of doctrine;</hi> whence I inferred, that ſith the doctrine of Popery teacheth ſo many things, whereof there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be found in the Epiſtle to the Romans, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that doctrine which was at firſt deliuered to the Church of Rome. To this he ſhould haue directly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and haue ſhewed vs that their Popery is to bee proued by the Epiſtle to the Romans. But from this he ſtealeth away, and to dawbe vp this breach as well as he can, he maketh a ſcambling ſhift out of the reſt of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, and catcheth here and there a ſentence, as much to the purpoſe as if he had ſaid nothing. But the trimmeſt ieſt of all is his anſwer to that which I vrged as touching S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Peter, <hi>whom they haue made the founder and head of their Church, that it is ſtrange that he ſhould forget the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple crowne; that he ſhould ſay nothing for Popery, no not a word; that nothing hindereth in either of his Epiſtles, but that he muſt be taken for a Proteſtant.</hi> What doth <hi>M.
